         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My LORDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was a Cuſtom much us'd by
the Ancient Writers among
the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:57792:4"/>
Dedicate their Books to their moſt
particular Friends, and ſometimes
to Intitle and call them by their
Friends Names. In our Age,
wherein we either do, or ſhou'd
imitate Antiquity in all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
things, This laudable
Cuſtom is either wholly laid aſide,
or practis'd by ſo few, that they
almoſt eſcape Obſervance. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this Method of Dedicating
Books was chang'd into a better,
I ſhould have no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
but rather to applaud the
happy Genius of our Times, for
outſhining the brighteſt days
of Antiquity: But moſt aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we can find no cauſes for ſuch
Triumphs. The Dedications now
made in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi>
(which two Countries in this Age,
we may Parallel with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
<hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> upon
<pb facs="tcp:57792:5"/>
the Score of Excellence in Wit,
with reſpect to the reſt of <hi>Europe)</hi>
Our Dedications, I ſay, are ſo full
of nauſeous and fulſom Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and Moſt of 'em ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made up of about a dozen long
Words, variouſly turn'd and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd;
that for my part, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how any Man can proceed
any further in a Book of ſuch
ſmall hopes, but muſt needs lay
it down, and chuſe rather to go
to Bounding-Stones with <hi>Auguſtus.</hi>
Nay, this crying Sin of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is come to that paſs, that even
our Poets, who were made and
fram'd on purpoſe in ſuch a
Make, as only to laſh Vice with
the ſevereſt Satyr, are yet moſt
abominably guilty of this crime.
When an excellent Comedy has
appear'd on the Stage for ſome
time, and perhaps done the Work
<pb facs="tcp:57792:5"/>
of an Hundred Homilies, in
viſiting and reclaiming Mankind
from their evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ways; it comes
forth in Print, and all is ſpoil'd
again by a wicked Dedication in
the beginning, which propagat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
Atheiſm; ſo that no man can
believe the Poet is honeſt, and
ſpeaks his mind in the Play,
while he talks ſo lewdly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorily
in the Dedication: It
was not ſo in <hi>Ben. Johnſon</hi>'s days.</p>
            <p>What I have ſaid of Epiſtles
Dedicatory in general, may part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeem to hook my ſelf into the
crowd of theſe numerous Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors,
while I inſcribe this
Book to your Great Names. But
ſeveral Things I have to alledg
for my ſelf. Firſt, tho this Piece
be not preſented to any private
Friend of its Author in Emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Ancients; yet as far as
<pb facs="tcp:57792:6"/>
poſſibly, I have followed their
Sacred Rules and Canons, in a
Work of this publick Nature.
For it is the Life of one of the
Greateſt and Wiſeſt Princes that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver Sway'd the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or any
other Scepter: And to whom
cou'd I better devote His Life,
than to His Greateſt and Wiſeſt
Friends, (for ſuch <hi>He</hi> always
call'd His beſt Servants?) Ye are
concern'd, MY LORDS, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Page of this Book, and can
witneſs what is here related, to
be true. No part of His Life,
but wherein ſome of you have
had a ſhare; In His Education,
His Exile, His Sufferings, His
Victories, His Triumphs. And
while I write his Life, in ſome
meaſure I write Yours. For ſuch
is the fate of Celſitude and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that Great Men (in ſome
<pb facs="tcp:57792:6"/>
ſenſe) do frequently Dye before
Sixty three: And to be ſure, when
a Prince falls, he does not fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
but ſeveral Others have
their Lives interchangeably writ
with his.</p>
            <p>Beſides, MY LORDS, being
unable to find any Object nearer
to him, than Your ſelves, except
his Majeſty, (whom God long
preſerve) and the Family Royal;
I lay under an indiſpenſable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of imploring your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
Patronage: For ſuch is my
Veneration to the Blood of my
Prince, that by no means can I be
perſwaded to think the enſuing
Papers fit for his moſt Sacred and
Princely Eye, or worthy a Royal
Protection; and I am reſolv'd to
be as Innocent as I can, and
not offend One Prince, after
having committed Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Fame of another.
<pb facs="tcp:57792:7"/>
However, MY LORDS, tho this
be not a Piece fit for a Kings Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet;
yet I hope this Image of
our late Sovereigns Life will not
be refus'd by Your Lordſhips,
ſince we love the Pictures of thoſe
Perſons we admire, let 'em be
never ſo unfiniſht, let them be
drawn by what hand ſoever.</p>
            <p>The other Thing which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to my ſelf in this Addreſs,
was the avoiding Flattery; tho
it may ſeem a very unneceſſary
Caution; ſince he that looks up to
ſuch a Thick-ſet Conglobation,
and (as it were) Galaxy of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Virtues, muſt eaſily infer,
that they are too high for Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and too bright to have any
luſtre added to them. With all
the Tragical forces of Eloquence
I might here expatiate on the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks
of Grand Deſcent, of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
<pb facs="tcp:57792:7"/>
and honours, of Policy and
Government, of Arms and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
of the Tent and the Cloſet:
But it is not my deſign to manage
theſe common Subjects. And I
beg leave of your Lordſhips to
ſay, That in the front of a Book
conſecrated to the fame of
CHARLES the II<hi>d,</hi> I think I
ſhou'd do an Injury to him, if I
endeavour'd profeſſedly to write
any other Panegyrick but his;
tho at the ſame time I muſt needs
include Your Lordſhips Praiſes.
And herein I have determin'd to
take a View of the King himſelf,
and not of his Deeds, (that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
I leave to his hiſtory) and
to ſet his perſonal Virtues, and
not additional Actions before your
Eyes; for a bad man may do a praiſe-worthy
thing, but a good man
himſelf can only be praiſed. Many
<pb facs="tcp:57792:8"/>
Kings themſelves do either hear
or read their own Commendations,
and take care to ſee their own
Glory ſetled before they dye:
But ſuch kind of Annals uſually
is as mortal as their Subject, and
as ſoon turns to Aſhes. No, His
late Majeſties Praiſe ſhall not be
Mercenary; The World after
his Death ſhall believe the King
was the leaſt Thing in him. And
Poſterity ſhall know the happineſs
of <hi>England</hi> and this Age, when
it ſhall ſee, we are not ſilent of a
good Prince after his Deceaſe;
for it is a ſign, that there is as
good a One, or a better on the
Throne.</p>
            <p>And this Task I the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
undertake, MY LORDS,
Firſt, becauſe it is impoſſible for
any man to want, or matter, or
words, while he writes of him;
<pb facs="tcp:57792:8"/>
and 'tis a Subject, that even Dulneſs
it ſelf wou'd Treat of wittily;
And ſecondly, becauſe not only
all <hi>Europe,</hi> but the whole World,
and Poſterity it ſelf, will joyn with
me in his Praiſes. For the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Rounds of the Earth were
acquainted with him; and he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd
our Commerce ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally,
that whatever Product was
generated in any Country, ſeem'd
to be the Native of Ours; and
in every Seaſon of the Year, we
had a perpetual Autumn, Fruits
arriving from every part of this
Globe. And as his Name will
be laid up in the Libraries of <hi>Aſia,</hi>
and men muſt hear his Praiſes by
Interpreters; ſo likewiſe, our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
no doubt, will help us in
praiſing him, who are at preſent
too much over-loaden with one
burthen, that of Grief for His
<pb facs="tcp:57792:9"/>
inexpreſſible loſs, to undertake
ſuch another as that of celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſeek to fetch Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums
from comparing him with
his Anceſtors, and ſo try by leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening
them, to amplifie his
Greatneſs: That is a trick, I do
not pretend to; let his fame ſtand
at the expence of no mans elſe.
For as all the Talents and Virtues
of his Forefathers, he in ſuch wiſe
united in himſelf, as that not one
of them was wanting while he
lived; and as it is common for a
Prince to be better than his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors,
but to be better than all
his Predeceſſors belong'd to him
alone; ſo he that detracts from
them, detracts from him. And
(for one inſtance) who dare ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiouſly
invade the Majeſty of
CHARLES the <hi>1ſt</hi> (in hopes to
<pb facs="tcp:57792:9"/>
diminiſh it) who neither ſaid, nor
did, nor wrote, nor begot any
thing but what was Great?</p>
            <p>So Divine a Prince, none was
thought worthy by Heav'n it ſelf,
immediately to Succeed but he:
And therefore, after that Nature
had made ſeveral Tryals in <hi>Henry
the Great's</hi> Daughter, for five
Years ſpace, towards the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of ſomething perfect and
abſolute, ſhe at length made this
acceptable Preſent to the World.
As ſoon as Born, Heaven took
notice of him, and ey'd him with
a Star, appearing in defiance of
the Sun at Noon-day, either to
note, That his Life ſhou'd be
continu'd with Miracles, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
with one; or that his Glory
ſhou'd ſhine like a Star; or elſe to
prove, That if it be queſtion'd,
whether Sovereigns be given us
<pb facs="tcp:57792:10"/>
by chance, or by the hand of the
Almighty, it is here manifeſt, that
this Prince came from Heav'n,
and that there is a World of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
put betwixt Kings ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally
made by God, and thoſe
electively made by Man.</p>
            <p>In his Education afterwards,
he excell'd in all thoſe corporal
Exerciſes, and that growth of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
for which Antiquity appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Sons of the Gods, and
Husbands of the Goddeſſes to be
ſo Remarkable. And as the ſhape
of his Body, ſo the form of his
mind was truly and univerſally
Imperial: It had the command
of whatever Notion or Thing was
preſented to it, whether Divine
or Humane, without any foreign
Explication; and as it were by
Intuition, he ſaw the Ideas of all
things in his own breaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57792:10"/>
In his firſt Years, he promis'd
that Virtue which his Fathers and
his own Miſeries gave him an
early and a large Field to ſhew to
the World, and which he kept en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
and unſhaken to the laſt; his
Mind being ſtill more and more
ſtrengthned by difficulties. And
(to ſpeak a little freely, MY
LORDS,) when Ye remember
him amid all his diſtreſſes, and
the moſt inſupportable ſtroaks of
Fortune, unrepining, and not let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the leaſt complaint eſcape
from him, or the leaſt fear ſeize
upon him; You muſt either fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
ſomething in him above Man,
or that the gods themſelves might
learn of him one Virtue, that of
conſtancy and firmneſs of mind;
For <hi>Seneca</hi> ſhews us, that <hi>Hercules</hi>
himſelf (the great and perfect
Model of true Virtue and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour)
<pb facs="tcp:57792:11"/>
in his laſt Agonies did
complain, ev'n to Deſperation.</p>
            <p>Adorn'd with ſuch Virtues, who
cou'd not but love him? Even Sea-Rebels
(as rough and boiſterous as
their own Element) grow ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted,
and ſet their Admiral
on ſhore, delivering themſelves
up to him; and the Love of <hi>the
Prince</hi> prevails more with them,
than the Piety of <hi>their King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When in Exile, as with his
Fame he had before fill'd other
Nations, ſo now he bleſs'd 'em
with his preſence. By barbarous
Rebels he was forc'd to venture
the Hoſpitality of Princes; yet
the King of <hi>France</hi> was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of abiding in the <hi>French</hi>
Kings Dominions. But whatever
jealouſies he might conceive of
his own ſafety; whatever bad news
he received from <hi>England;</hi> how
<pb facs="tcp:57792:11"/>
great ſoever were the Progreſſes
made by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> he thought
this his greateſt Unhappineſs, that
he ſhou'd have ſo many Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Friends both at home and
abroad.</p>
            <p>His Reſtoration I can compare
to nothing better, than that eaſie,
delicious, and jocund Temper of
the Elements, of Heaven, the Air,
and Sea, after a violent and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
Tempeſt, or rather after
the great Deluge of the World;
at <hi>which</hi> Time, he prov'd himſelf
the <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove, that finding no
Reſt any where, was receiv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into his own Ark, and
brought a peaceable <hi>Olive</hi>-Leaf
in his Mouth. <hi>Which</hi> Revolution
was the alone work of Providence
and the General. For nothing but
an Almighty Power hath Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over the minds of Men. He
<pb facs="tcp:57792:12"/>
did not leap on Shore with his
Sword in his Hand, by way of
Compulſion; but he was ſaluted
with the free and unanimous
Voice of three great Nations. As
he had no other real Enemies but
his own Country, ſo in this he
appeared <hi>more than Conqueror,</hi>
that he vanquiſh'd the very minds
of his enemies. Never was ſuch
a Triumph ſeen at <hi>Rome.</hi> Others
have rode on a Chariot with four
white Horſes, or more arrogantly
have been carri'd on Mens Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
but he was brought in by
the hearts of Men. That Name
which others get by conquer'd
Nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons, he got by repenting
ones; and only by returning out
of exile into his own Country
(which was exil'd, when he was
ſo) he lookt in the Poets Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb facs="tcp:57792:12"/>
               <q>
                  <l>Like <hi>Mars</hi> returning from the
Noble Chace</l>
                  <l>Of flying Nations through the
Plains of <hi>Thrace.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>At one time never was ſo much
Joy heap'd together in <hi>England.</hi>
It ſeem'd as if all the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
of the former years was
purpoſely deſigned to introduce
and heighten the ſo extravagant
gladneſs of that great Day, that
ſome were ready to wiſh for a
Renovation of the Civil Wars,
that they might have that day
repeated to them over again. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man thought that himſelf
received the ſhouts he gave; and
every ſubject fancied himſelf a
Monarch. The ſick imagine, they
are reſtored to health, by ſeeing
his God-like Perſon: Some cry,
they have lived long enough:
<pb facs="tcp:57792:13"/>
Others, Now they ought, rather,
to live longer. Traitors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
drink the King's Health
heartily: They admire him more,
that he wou'd not, than that ever
he ſhould be in a poſſibility to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
himſelf; and that he ſhou'd
remember Injuries only to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
them.</p>
            <p>Let him aſcend, and there was
a due Majeſty reſtor'd to the
Throne, Authority to the Laws,
Reverence to inferior Magiſtrates,
and the ſacred Order of Biſhops
to Religion, like a Treaſure found
from a Ship-wrack, after many
Years rouling in a tempeſtuous
Sea.</p>
            <p>Thus terminating all publick
differences and confuſions by
Peace, he adorn'd Peace it ſelf
with good Arts, which receiv'd
both their Countrey with him,
<pb facs="tcp:57792:13"/>
and their Protection under him,
by his opening the Temple of
<hi>Janus,</hi> and that of the <hi>Muſes</hi> at
the ſame time. For himſelf had
as great a Knowledg in Letters
as any Prince in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and
he moſt acurately underſtood Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,
Aſtronomy, and moſt
parts of the Mathematicks. An
huge delight he took in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
freely with the moſt knowing
Men in thoſe pleaſant and uſeful
Studies: And he endeavour'd to
promote them (as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
in others, by publick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments,
and Liberal Rewards.</p>
            <p>Beſides this ſeverer ſort of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices,
he had a great inſight into
all thoſe ſofter Arts which become
a private Gentleman. And in his
Reign we may ſay, That Wit
did firſt reign here, and appear'd
upon the Stage as on a Throne:
<pb facs="tcp:57792:14"/>
It was ſcarcely more encourag'd
and environ'd with greater Pomp
and Splendor at <hi>Rome,</hi> under the
peaceable Reign of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> after
that long Civil War, wherein the
Sword would permit nothing
elſe to be ſharp, beſides it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Tho he had as much Good-Nature
as wou'd perhaps have
ſerv'd an Hundred other Men
(a Word peculiar to our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Tongue, and a Thing peculiar
to this Prince, as the Great <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi>
remark'd), yet he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to take an extream delight
in that Part of Poeſy, which is
not very famous for Good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I mean <hi>Satyr.</hi> Doubtleſs
this ſort of Writing, is the beſt
and moſt beneficial of all others,
which the Poets follow; for it
not only tells Mankind of, but it
chaſtiſes them for their Faults.
<pb facs="tcp:57792:14"/>
And I wonder, that the Ancients,
when they beſtowed ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
kinds of Poetry to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Influence of ſo many
Muſes, they could not find in
their hearts to allow one Goddeſs
to <hi>Satyr.</hi> But whatever unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
it finds in Heaven, I am ſure
in our Age it has found Protection
upon earth, witneſs the great good
Offices the <hi>French</hi> King hath
done it in the Perſon of <hi>Boileau.</hi>
For, that Prince is not like <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſtamp and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
ſo wholly tranſported
with the Giddineſs of <hi>Romantick</hi>
Stories, as that he cannot dream
of conquering the World with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having <hi>Homer</hi> for his Bed-fellow;
but what he reads is good
ſenſe, and honeſt Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any vain and extravagant
additions. And this he does in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb facs="tcp:57792:15"/>
of his Late Majeſty (who
was the oldeſt, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
the moſt exemplary Prince
in the Chriſtian World), tho
under far worſe Circumſtances.
For the latter was much better ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated
through his <hi>extenſive</hi>
Knowledg in Nature, and the
Intricacies of Matter and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as well as in all Polite Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
and I think, I ſhou'd do no
man an Injury, if I ſay, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<hi>Butler</hi> the beſt in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How Good and Gracious a
Maſter he was, You MY LORDS,
can beſt declare; Ye knew him
the moſt ſearching Judg of Men,
that held in his hands both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and puniſhments: In the
laſt indeed, he was very ſparing;
and the offending Courtier was
uſually excus'd before hand, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſeldom to be excus'd. The
<pb facs="tcp:57792:15"/>
Puniſhment, he thought, was
ſufficient in the very Vexation of
the Delinquent. Warily and by
Degrees, his Rewards were diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted,
that there might ſtill be a
further Proſpect in view by way
of Encouragement; For nothing
conduces more to following Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
than the former well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred:
And never at one leap
was any ſupreme place conferred,
unleſs for ſome Tranſcendent,
and (as I may call it) ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce of Loyalty. Our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſſe
he both preſerved and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented;
leſt the condition of
ſuch ſhould be worſe, as deſerved
to have a Noble Poſterity, than
of ſuch as had Noble Anceſtors.
Not a Soldier was there, that had
received Wounds in his Service,
but he counted, and rewarded
them in an ample manner: And
<pb facs="tcp:57792:16"/>
thorough all ſucceeding Ages
He will be a Benefactor as well
as an example to Soldiers at <hi>Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea;</hi>
where as long as we ſhall have
a Country to Defend, or an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to Combate, His Name
will be evermore remembred, for
what is beſtow'd upon Poſterity,
ought to be Immortal.</p>
            <p>You likewiſe, MY LORDS,
can give the beſt Atteſtation to his
Offices of Privacy, and his great
Virtues of Humility and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention,
which yet had a kind
of Majeſtick Royalty with them.
Ye remember him, when he was
in Exile, and as a private man,
how he reſembled a King; and
how whileſt a reſtored Monarch,
and in his moſt illuſtrious days,
he ſeem'd to be a private Citizen.
That in his greateſt Proſperity he
had not the leaſt Haughtineſs nor
<pb facs="tcp:57792:16"/>
Elation of Mind; but being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
of his own greatneſs, was not
afraid of degrading himſelf into
the likeneſs of a Subject. Ye
know, how much time he beſtow'd
on the cares of Empire, how much
on the Duties of Devotion, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
and Vertue; how ſhort
his Sleeps, and the unbendings of
his mind were: A ſmart walk, a
mouthful of freſh Air, and a little
ingenious raillery.</p>
            <p>Such a Prince muſt needs be no
leſs lov'd than admir'd: The Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
and Reverence of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
wou'd ſtand him inſtead of
terror. His own Virtue wou'd
ſerve him for a Guard, and his
Sword rather for Ornament than
Defence.</p>
            <p>But what Charms can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Ingratitude and Malice
of accurſed and diabolick Rebels?
<pb facs="tcp:57792:17"/>
Againſt his Sacred Life we had a
<hi>Salamanca-Plot,</hi> wherein the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers
ſeem'd to be more choqu'd
at the Injuſtice of the Evidence,
than at the ſeverity of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
They ſeem'd to bear all
magnanimouſly, and with the
bravery of Innocence. And with
good reaſon might they do ſo,
ſince they had for a Co-partner in
Diſhonour (which to her was worſe
than Death) the moſt Pious, and
Virtuous Princeſs that <hi>England</hi>
ever deſerv'd to ſee. We had,
likewiſe, a moſt helliſh Fanatick
Conſpiracy, the Diſcovery of
which diſcover'd ALL. Then
Heaven began to look kindly
down upon us, and withdraw
its Plagues, eſpecially that great
<hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkneſs, wherewith
we had been blinded: And the
Froggs and Vermine which were
<pb facs="tcp:57792:17"/>
got into the Royal Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
found it high time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede.
Then the <hi>Delatores</hi> began to
fear as much as they were fear'd
before: And the Laws were now
more dreaded than perjur'd Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks.
Then Sham-Magiſtrates
put off their conſulary Honours,
and public Spoils; And the King of
<hi>England</hi> became firſt LORD OF
LONDON: Which City, while
he reſtrain'd its Liberties, he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
more free.</p>
            <p>But here, MY LORDS, we
come to a full point; and here
ye muſt take your leave of him.
For when he had run thorough
all the violences of a tumultuary
Life, when he had eſcap'd all
theſe dangers of impious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
men, when he now had
eſtabliſh'd His Throne in Safety,
Peace and Righteouſneſs, and (as
<pb facs="tcp:57792:18"/>
we may properly ſay) juſt now
began to enjoy himſelf, and you
him, behold! He is taken away
from you. Who can forbear
complaining of the uncertain
Eſtate and frail Condition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
kind, when neither the moſt
ineſtimable riches and un-periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Graces of the mind, nor the
moſt enlarged Extremities of
Glory and Greatneſs, ſpreading
on the one hand towards the
War-like Thunder, or on the
other towards the Peaceful
Scepter, nor even the hearty and
united Prayers of a Virtuous
People, cou'd impart Efficacy
enough to make one Perſon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,
or ſhould be able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the diſunion of one Soul from
a Body? That he who had his
youthful Years try'd by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
of a gloomy Fate, and had

Degrees of Fame by ſtaining the

who was the Supreme Arbiter of
Life and Death, and <hi>Europe</hi>'s
Moderator, [who when moved,

he had lived an hundred Years,
the People would never have
been tired with his Government,
ſhould dye like one of us?</p>
            <p>But let this be our Conſolation,
that when ordinary men dye, they
dye; but when a Good Prince
expires, it is not his Death, but
his immediate <hi>Apotheoſis:</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
flies to the Kingdom of
Heaven, and there reigneth for
evermore (as alſo here by his
<pb facs="tcp:57792:19"/>
example) exchanging a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
for an Eternal Crown of
Glory. Leſt therefore we ſhould
ſeem to repine at his happineſs,
let us no longer think two Eyes
too few to pay the Tribute of our
Tears, and bedew his Aſhes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
Let not every Subject weep,
as if it were at his Fathers Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
not only ſomething of his
own Accord, but more out of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
and the command of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
Let not this one Spectacle
be as hideous and doleful as that
of <hi>Xerxes</hi> numerous Army; Let
not the Maps of the whole Earth
in proportion to the dimenſions
of his Fame, be hung in Black;
Let not that colour be the Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Mens Souls as well as their
Bodies any longer; And let not
the very Graces and Joy it ſelf
weep any more; Neither let the
<pb facs="tcp:57792:20"/>
expreſſions of our ſorrow be as
abundant as our ſorrovv it ſelf:
in regard he himſelf took the
greateſt care imaginable in his
Life-time, that we ſhould not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
his Death, and that he
ſhould not be miſs't; but has left
us not only a Succeſſor, but (in
a manner) the Partner and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of his Throne, and
(which is above all) his Deareſt
Friend; ſo that we have not loſt,
but only chang'd a Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yereign,
in whom we find ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
God-like Perfections, that we
ſhall never be tempted to adore
the Former, now ſince his tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and pay Religious Worſhip
to him, inſtead of Allegiance.</p>
            <p>And now, MY LORDS, what
remains? But, That as nothing
could have repair'd our ineffable
Loſs of CHARLES the II<hi>d,</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:57792:20"/>
the Succeſſion of JAMES the II<hi>d,</hi>
we proſtrate our ſelves at the feet
of Almighty God, by whom Kings
Reign; imploring him, that it may
be many Years, before we have
the ſame occaſion for Grief; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up our Vows for the Kings
Health, and the Eternity of this
Empire, that he would grant
him a long and a proſperous
Reign over us; that never his
Breaſt may be ſenſible of any ſigh

Dead; <hi>That his days may be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

That as he hath been the Great

ſo many <hi>Perils in War, Perils

and [that we may ſee that
CHARLES is not yet dead] ſtill
live to demonſtrate, that Heaven
is infinite in its Mercies, and does
embrace both him and it ſelf in

him ſo happy, that if the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was given to any One of

which Treats of the <hi>Lives</hi> of Eminent

and thoroughly <hi>digeſted</hi> by the
moſt <hi>reaching Genius,</hi> and moſt <hi>conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated</hi>
Wit?</p>
            <p>Wherefore, to ſatisfie thee, <hi>Reader,</hi>
and thy Objection, I will tell and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thee, That the <hi>Author</hi> is <hi>partly</hi>
(I do ſay) more acquainted with the
great <hi>difficulty</hi> as well as <hi>uſe</hi> of Hiſtory
in <hi>general;</hi> and that for his <hi>own</hi>
Part, <hi>This</hi> which thou haſt here,
he hath been <hi>long</hi> about theſe many
years, and that it is no <hi>Muſhroom buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
ſpringing up from a <hi>foggy.</hi> Brain in
one Night, and as likely to periſh by
<hi>another.</hi> It is a <hi>thoughtful</hi> Piece, no
<hi>illegitimate Brat,</hi> no Sham-extract
<hi>Verbatim</hi> out of other Books, which
thou haſt perhaps <hi>read</hi> and <hi>paid</hi> for
<hi>already.</hi> For I ſhould be very loath (if
I knew ſuch a thing) to ſo be <hi>unconſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi>
to impoſe upon thee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57792:23"/>
But now perhaps from my <hi>Anſwer</hi> to
the <hi>former</hi> Objection, thou wilt be
ready to raiſe another, and look upon
my <hi>Author</hi> as no <hi>kind Wiſher</hi> to his
<hi>Prince,</hi> to go and write his Life <hi>before</hi>
his Demiſs, which reſembles a kind of
an <hi>Expectation</hi> of his <hi>Death,</hi> rather
than the <hi>putting</hi> up any hearty <hi>Prayers</hi>
for the <hi>Continuance</hi> of his Life, as every
<hi>good Subject</hi> ought to do.</p>
            <p>In <hi>return</hi> to this, I am ſtill of the
<hi>Affirmitive</hi> ſide, and will again <hi>aſſure</hi>
thee, That he is a very <hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Gentlemen,</hi> and that thou wilt <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
me, as ſoon as thou haſt <hi>read</hi> his
Book. And beſides (to <hi>conſider</hi> the
thing in <hi>it ſelf)</hi> 'tis ſo <hi>far</hi> from being
an <hi>Act</hi> that looks any ways <hi>Diſloyal,</hi> to
write a Princes Life before his <hi>Deceaſe,</hi>
that on the <hi>other hand</hi> it is extreamly
Loyal and Meritorious. As we ſee
now in <hi>France,</hi> where an <hi>Annual Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
is ſetled upon the <hi>Great Satyriſt</hi> to
write the Life of his Maſter, the
<hi>French King.</hi> Indeed, this I will <hi>add</hi>
in my Authors behalf, that I have heard
him ſay, he never deſir'd to live to
finiſh his Book; but Addreſſed Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the contrary; <hi>hoping</hi> it might
prove a <hi>Picture</hi> and Draught of the
<pb facs="tcp:57792:24"/>
               <hi>Kings Life</hi> only to the <hi>middle.</hi> But
ſince <hi>Heaven</hi> has thought fit to take
our Gracious Prince to it <hi>ſelf,</hi> I prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with him to <hi>reviſe</hi> the whole <hi>Work,</hi>
and make an <hi>addition</hi> to ſuch years as
was <hi>wanting:</hi> Which being compleated,
I here preſent to the Publick View. For
you may gheſs, <hi>Reader,</hi> that when <hi>we
Book ſellers</hi> have got any thing of this
<hi>Nature,</hi> it is as <hi>ſevere</hi> a piece of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi>
and <hi>Self-denial</hi> to keep it
<hi>private,</hi> as it is for our <hi>Gallants</hi> to
keep their <hi>Chambers</hi> the ſame Day
they have got a <hi>new Suit.</hi> Adieu.</p>

               <p>HIſtory, in all Ages, hath not undeſervedly
been accounted the great Light and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
of Humane Life; as it both plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurably
inſtructs, and moſt efficaciouſly
perſuades all Ranks and Degrees of men, to their
ſeveral reſpective and proper Offices. For, in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Foundation of a Good Mind, Examples
have a peculiar force to move men to Virtue, and
a much Greater, than any bare Precepts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever;
ſince they have this excellence in them,
that they prove, what they recommend, poſſible
to be done, and a Precept without an Example ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd
to it, looks like a good Law never put into
Execution. When men read of an Excellent Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
they ſtill carry away ſome Tincture from it,
whether they will or no, as if they had been in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation
with it's Poſſeſſor; And when they
read of any deformity and vice, they have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57792:32"/>
averſion for it, and will take care to avoid
in themſelves, what looks ſo ugly in others.</p>
               <p>Nor does Hiſtory tend only to form men's man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
in order to an happy Life, but it alſo exalts
and enlarges their minds, while they take a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of all Generations, that have been upon Earth
before them. They ſeem to give Eternity to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

they have read in Chronicles. And, by this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the time paſt, they judge of the preſent, and
proceed to the fore-ſight of the future: For the beſt
<hi>Aſtrology</hi> in the World is to be deriv'd from
Hiſtory, and from the Conſideration of thoſe
Luminaries, that have mov'd in a Sphere above
us, either in point of Time, or of Place.</p>
               <p>Which ſince we ſee to be the Proper ends and
uſes of Hiſtory, without doubt that Hiſtory is
highly to be eſteem'd, which does not conſiſt ſo
much of Magnificent and Pompous things, as the
Deſcription of Wars, of Great Buildings, and
ſuch matters as only bring an empty pleaſure to
the Reader, but which does exhibit things uſeful

mind. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this account the Lives of Eminent

bearing a Relation and Analogy thereunto. And
his kind cannot ſtand without the fore-mention'd
Additionals (as I may Stile them) and not Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials
of Hiſtory, as Arms, and Fortifications,
and the like matters: Which though they do
concern no man in himſelf, as to point of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
yet together with the great Delight they
bring along with them, they are mainly conducive
to the well-fare of mankind in general, and the
Knowledge of 'em is requiſite to many particular
men, as immediately ingag'd in them, and is, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
univerſally Ornamental.</p>
               <p>Which things being well weigh'd, I think I have
got under my Pen, one of the moſt profitable, as
well as diverting Hiſtories, the Sun ever yet ſaw
acted: It being the Life of a Prince, which
may be an Example not only to publick but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
men. For it affords us the knowledge of
Heaven, and reads us a Lecture of Piety, Juſtice,
Patience, Fortitude, and Clemency: Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
virtues in a Prince, have a ſingular Grace
with 'em. It is not an account of the Robberies of
an <hi>Alexander,</hi> but a Regiſter of Providential
Bounties and Appointments; beautified with the
various Scenes and Landskips of Humane Life,
to inſtruct our Judgments, and amuſe our Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
It teaches us the Arts of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and
Concord, and draws out the true lines of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Government. It cures thoſe diſeaſes of the
mind, Inſolence, ſelf-conceit, and Ambition, and
ſhews, that it is the Subjects Intereſt as well as
Duty, to obey.</p>
               <p>Theſe are all things but of <hi>Yeſterdays</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

that before hand, I need not make any Profeſſions
here of my truth and ſincerity, in the following
Relation, it being not ſo eaſy to deceive as to be
refell'd in things, not in the leaſt remote from
our knowledge. This indeed is all, I have the
vanity to fear, that, if this Book ſhould happen to
deſcend to Poſterity, they will rather think it the
Panegyrick than Hiſtory of our late admirable
Prince, becauſe when I report nothing of him but
what was landable, they may gheſs, that I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted,
what was worthy reprehenſion.</p>
               <p>The moſt renowned and mighty Monarch
<hi>CHARLES</hi> the Second, late King of <hi>England,</hi>
was in greatneſs of his Royal Deſcent, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour

St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who was ſent by <hi>Gregory</hi>

where he was born, which ſeemed from
Heaven to congratulate his Birth, by
darting its promiſing Influence upon the
place of it, and diſplaying is officious
Beams in the midſt of that Air, wherein
he firſt drew breath, notwithſtanding the
ſtrenuous oppoſition of the ſhining Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

that bleſſing which he deſired above all

               <p>He was committed in his Infancy to
the indulgent Care, and pious Tuition of
the Counteſs of <hi>Dorſet;</hi> and when his
growing parts rendred him too maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
for a Feminine Conduct, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> under
whoſe Direction and Government he
imbib'd thoſe Principles of Virtue, and
deſire of Learning, which ſerv'd as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
to fit and prepare him for his
farther and more liberal Education, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Learned Dr. <hi>Duppa,</hi> Dean of
<hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi>
by whoſe extraordinary Pains and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
his Great Soul was firſt ſeaſoned
with thoſe Rudiments of Knowledge and
Learning, which afterward by his own
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57792:37"/>
obſervation and experience received ſo
vaſt an increaſe, and rendred him that
ſagacious and politick, as well as good
and gracious, King, which the whole
<hi>ſeries</hi> of his Reign diſcovered him to
be.</p>
               <p>About this time, by Order, not Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he was firſt called Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi>
the Revenues belonging to each of them
being aſſigned him for the maintenance
of his Court, the ſeveral Offices whereof
were pitcht upon and appointed by the
King his Father who, taking great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to ſee his Children about him, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Prince to attend him in ſeveral
of his Progreſſes, and particularly in that
to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where they were entertained
with the acting of the Royal Slave, which
prov'd too prophetick of both their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Calamities. During his abode
there, his Diſcourſe with ſeveral Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Doctors was ſo extraordinary, and
above the common capacity of his years,
that it adminiſtred matter of amazement
and wonder to the whole Univerſity.</p>
               <p>In the Parliament, which was called
ſoon after, he took his place among
the Peers, who were now his equals,
but were hereafter to become his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57792:38"/>
Subjects, and there he firſt tryed how
a Coronet would fit his Royal Head,
before the death of his Father called him
to wear the Imperial Crown; and about
this time he was with great Solemnity
inſtalled Knight of the Garter, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with divers of the Nobility who
were his Attendance, and received the
ſame Honour with him.</p>
               <p>But after all this a ſad misfortune
dampt the publick Joy and threatned
the untimely ſetting of our Riſing Sun,
for in the year 39 he firſt brake his Arm
and was afterward afflicted with a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Fever and a ſmall ſpice of the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
but it was not long before thoſe
Clouds of fear were diſſipated by the
perfect recovery of his health.</p>
               <p>Some unhappy miſunderſtandings
beginning now to grow between his
Father and the Parliament who, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a King would do no wrong him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
reſolved to call ſome of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to an account for pretended miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,
among whom the moſt Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
was the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who firſt
led the way, being by no known Law,
as that Judicious King, who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the Tryal, declared attainted of
Treaſon, and the King prevailed upon
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57792:38"/>
by the Importunity of his People,
and a Letter from the Earl himſelf,
(who rather choſe to be made a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
than to hazard his Majeſties Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,)
to ſign a Warrant for his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
But the King's tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
being extreamly checkt and
troubled for that unwilling conſent,
preſently ſent a Letter to the Peers,
which was written with his own
Hand, to deſire them to forbear, or
at leaſt delay, the Execution of his
Sentence, and, that it might be the
more prevalent with them, he ſent it
by the Prince, which was the firſt
Publick Buſineſs we find him imployed
in, which, being a work of Mercy,
proved ſo good an <hi>Omen</hi> of his own
Inclination, that it afterward became
ſo predominant in him, as even to
rejoyce over his exacteſt Juſtice, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he could not then prevail on
the behalf of that unfortunate Earl:
And not long after we find him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in another Publick Buſineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the Chief Aſſiſtants in
the performing the Solemnities of his
Siſters Marriage with the Prince of
<hi>Orange.</hi>

The fatal Breach between the King
and Parliament growing ſtill wider, and
haſtening to an unnatural Rupture,
he reſolved, notwithſtanding many
of his Nobles and Faithful Servants
proffered their Service to curb any
Inſolencies that ſhould be attempted
on him, to remove himſelf ſome time
from <hi>London,</hi> hoping that thereby their
Jealouſies and Rumours would waſt
and periſh; and therefore commanded
the Prince, together with his Queen,
and ſome of his Servants, to attend him
at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> whither ſome Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
being ſent to him for a Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they made their firſt Application
to the Prince, as the moſt proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
between the King and his two
Houſes of Parliament: So early was
it, that he began to tread in the ſteps
and labour to imitate his Grandfather,
in becoming a Peace-maker, which not
ſucceeding according to expectation,
he accompanied his Father, together
with the preſent King to <hi>Theobalds,</hi>
leaving the Rebels to fret themſelves at
their eſcape, and from thence into the
North, where he beheld a black Cloud
begin to gather which, though ſmall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57792:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in appearance, yet was big with that
diſmal Storm, that in a ſhort time
ſpread it ſelf over his Father, himſelf,
and three Nations: For the King, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
to <hi>Hull,</hi> to take a view of that
Magazine, which his Treaſure had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed,
and his Crown claimed as one
of its <hi>Jura Regalia,</hi> the Magiſtrate
thereof bearing a Sword by a Power
only derived from him, without which
Majeſty it ſelf is but a Solemn Trifle,
and Authority but a gilded Pageantry,
He was by Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> who was
ſent thither by the Parliament, denied
Entrance, and forced to wait with the
Prince and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> at the
Gate of that Garriſon, and could at laſt
prevail for nothing more, but only his
two Sons being admitted as Children,
to ſee the Town; which when they had
done, they accompanied their Father
to <hi>York,</hi> whom they now beheld de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of that which <hi>Gr. Tholoſanus</hi>
calls the chiefeſt Flower in a Prince's
Diadem, and diſarmed of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
which of right belonged to him,
where the Prince was by his Father
made a Captain of a choice Guard of
Loyal Nobles and Gentlemen, who
there repaired to him: For ſuch was
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57792:40"/>
the Indulgent Care he had of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
that he reſolved they ſhould
hazard themſelves no farther in the
defence of his Perſon, than he would
hazard himſelf for the defence of their
Laws &amp; Liberties; and that his Eldeſt Son,
who was to ſucceed him in his Crown &amp;
Dignity, ſhould accompany them in
all thoſe Dangers to which they ſhould
expoſe themſelves. In which Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he attended his Father, through the
ſeveral Stages he paſt, as a Partner with
him in his Troubles, the greateſt
whereof was, as himſelf declares in
his incomparable <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his

in thoſe Troubles, that deſerved
to have been born to better For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Edghill</hi> Fight, notwithſtanding
the tenderneſs of his years, he gave
ſuch proof of his Valour and Courage,
and was ſo little terrified with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
noiſe of Guns, Drums and Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
the prancing of Horſes, and the
claſhing of Swords, to which he had
till then never been uſed, that the Earl
of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> who obſerved it, ſaid to
thoſe about him, There is a Child born
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57792:40"/>
to end that War we now begin. But the
Battel being loſt, he returned to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Care of his Kinſman, the
Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford,</hi> then Chancellor
of that Univerſity, who provided him
ſeveral Tutors in each Language, Art
and Science, wherein it concerned him
as a Prince to be acquainted; and he
applied himſelf to his Studies with as
much pain and ſeriouſneſs as the
ſevereſt Gown-man in the place,
his great Soul entertaining nothing
but deep thoughts, profound Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims,
and Intricate Myſteries, and he
would ſeverely rebuke the unſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Speeches that tortured his chaſter
Ears, and condemn thoſe Oaths and
Curſes which were too common among
the vainer Scholars; during which time
he was viſited with the Meaſels, the
danger whereof only ſerv'd to teach us
how to prize him the more for that
hazard.</p>
               <p>But the War between his Father and
the Parliament ſtill growing more fierce,
he once more left the Univerſity and
took the Field, laying aſide his Books,
that he might handle his Arms, and
endeavoured to ſignalize his Valour by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57792:41"/>
appearing in the Head of ſome Forces
in the North, which were conducted
by the Earls of <hi>Cumberland</hi> and <hi>New-caſtle,</hi>
wherein he was ſo ſucceſsful at
firſt, that Victory ſeemed to wait on
his Banner.</p>
               <p>Shortly after he marcht Weſtward,
where by order from the Court he
was attended by ſuch a Noble Retinue
as was moſt ſuitable to the Grandeur
of a Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> about which time
he caſt off his <hi>Ich Dien,</hi> and aſſum'd
his State, ſetting up his Royal Court,
and making choice of ſuch Officers as
were moſt pleaſing to him; about
which although his Father took ſome
exception, yet he proteſted that he
greatly admired the diſcretion of his
choice in general, having ſo brave and
well ordered a Family that it was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
to none, but his Uncle <hi>Henrys;</hi>
and King-ſhip was firſt exerciſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the narrow compaſs of an Houſhold,
(ſaith <hi>Selden,)</hi> which increaſing to
Cities, Kings were content to Reign
therein until thoſe Cities, ſwelling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Nations, they enlarged the bounds
of their Soveraign Rule.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> about this time,
hoping to make an advantage of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57792:41"/>
Kings neceſſity, offered ſeveral fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals,
ſuitable to his preſent exigencies
and troubles, which were uſhered in
by the offer of a Match between his
Daughter and the Prince, but for ſome
reaſons of State, his Father thought
not fit to accept the offer, but yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
ſuch an anſwer as held him in
ſuſpence, being not willing either to
gratifie or diſpleaſe him.</p>
               <p>The Prince, in the mean while, was
buſily employing himſelf in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to make up a much happier
Match between his Father and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
by ſome overtures of Peace
which he made to Sir <hi>Thom. Fairfax,</hi>
the Chief Commander of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Forces,
but was diſappointed
therein, for <hi>Fairfax</hi> gave him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that thoſe Propoſals were fitter to
be made to the Parliament, than to him,
who was only their Servant: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he, ſeeing that <hi>Fairfax</hi> would do
nothing himſelf towards a Peace, being
reſolved to try all poſſible means for
the ſetling this diſtracted Kingdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
leave for the Lord <hi>Hopton</hi> and
<hi>Culpeper</hi> to attend the King and media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
with him for a treaty with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
to which <hi>Fairfax</hi> anſwered
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57792:42"/>
that he would deſire the Prince to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
his Army, and promiſed that he
would thereupon conduct him with
Honour to the Parliament, to which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
he commanded the Lord <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>
to make the following Anſwer,
<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> His Highneſs did not believe that
his overture, in engaging himſelf in the
Mediation of a Bleſſed Peace for this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Kingdom, would have brought him
an Inhibition to quit his duty to his
Father, by dividing his Intereſt from
that of his Majeſties, or hereby he
ſhould render himſelf unworthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of the fruit of that Peace, which
he laboured to obtain, and that of his
former propoſitions might be conſented
to, he hoped God would ſo bleſs his
ſincere intentions and deſigns, as to
make him a Bleſſed Inſtrument to
preſerve this Kingdom from deſolation,
but if that were rejected he ſhould
give the World no cauſe to believe
that he would forfeit that Honour,
which only could preſerve him in a
capacity of doing that ſervice, and
ſhould with patience attend Gods plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
until his endeavours might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
with the preſervation of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:57792:42"/>
During his abode in the Camp, he
ſhew'd himſelf to be of ſuch an Heroick
Temperature, that he enjoyed an equal
Calm and Peace in the midſt of all the
Confuſions of War, and enjoyed his Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Thoughts as quietly in the Tumults
of a Camp, as in the Retirements of a
School. In the exerciſing of his Arms,
he did not wholly leave his Books, nor
forget his Studies, eſpecially of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,
which, beſides their general
uſefulneſs, as Refiners of the Mind, were
more than ordinarily neceſſary to him,
to aſſiſt him in carrying on the ſeveral
Stratagems of War in Fortification, Sieges,
Battels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wherein he was but little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his incomparable Father, in theſe
things the exacteſt Prince in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>But, not being able to accompliſh that
Reconciliation between his Father and the
Parliament which he deſigned, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
again to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he was
more ſucceſsful in another undertaking
of the like nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the reconciling his
two Couſins, <hi>Rupert</hi> &amp; <hi>Maurice,</hi> to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
accounting it too hard to entertain
inward Broils, when outward Calamities
were ſo heavy and preſſing, and that
thoſe who had Adverſaries enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57792:43"/>
ought not to become each others
Enemies: nor did he only uſe his Intereſt
with his Father, to be reconciled to the
two Princes, but even to his open and
profeſt Enemies alſo, notwithſtanding
the failure of his late undertakings, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by his Letters to the Speaker of
the Houſe of Commons of <hi>Decemb. 15,
26,</hi> &amp; 29. and that of <hi>Jan.</hi> 25, 17, 24. and
ſeveral others. But, while he was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

had made implacable, &amp; guilt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

Meſſages purſuing each o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſo faſt as the Waves do in a Storm, and
coming as thick as the Meſſengers of <hi>Jobs</hi>

ſafety, and (ſince he could not by all his

ſuaſions procure a pacification either by
Art or Arguments, dint of Sword, or
ſtrength of Reaſon,) preſerve himſelf, the

ſucceſs apply his ſoveraign Balm
to heal the bleeding Breaches of the
three dying Nations.</p>
               <p>Whereupon he went from thence, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the Lords <hi>Goring</hi> and <hi>Culpep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Edw. Hide,</hi> to the Iſle of <hi>Scilly,</hi>
which ſtill remained in the King's hands;
where he was no ſooner arrived, but he
received a ſolemn Invitation from the
Parliament in a ſeeming tender &amp; dutiful
way, to come to them, and remain in ſuch
places as they ſhould think convenient,
and entertain ſuch Attendants &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
only as ſhould be appointed by
them. Upon receiving of which Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he adviſed with thoſe about him,
what was beſt to be done in that caſe, and
they returned the following Anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That it became not him to do any
thing in a matter of that concern, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Fathers privity, advice, and free
conſent; and therefore, before he could
ſatisfie the Honourable Houſe, he deſired
a Paſs might be granted to the L <hi>Capel</hi> to
go to the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to take his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57792:44"/>
Advice, and hearken to his Royal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and make ſome overtures to him in
order to a Peace. He deſired likewiſe the
aſſiſtance of the Reverend Father in God,
the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
toward the Publick was ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
and inoffenſive, that even Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
it ſelf entertained not the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
of him.</p>
               <p>But, through the ill Influence ſome
perſons had on Publick Councils, there
was nothing done in either of thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
althô, when Providence was
pleaſed to deprive him of Civil Comfort,
and Secular Attendants, it had been but
charity to have ſupplied him with ſome
faithful, good and able Chaplain, by
whoſe Piety, Learning and Prayers, he
might be the better enabled to ſuſtain
the want of all other Enjoyments. But
they not only refuſed to gratifie him in
that reaſonable Requeſt, but alſo by an
Ordinance barr'd him from all future
converſe with ſuch Loyal Attendants, as
would otherwiſe have willingly waited
on him there, to deceive the tediouſneſs of
that Solitude; ſo that thoſe, who would
now adventure to repair to him, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their unhappy abſence by the civil
correſpondence of a Letter, were to die
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57792:44"/>
without mercy. During his abode there, he
ſpent a day or two in viewing the Iſle of
<hi>Gernſey,</hi> the only remainder of our Rights
to <hi>Normandy,</hi> to try if peradventure the
perſons, or the place, would furniſh him
with the knowledge of any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he was a Stranger before, and which
he might obſerve for the future benefit
of his Kingdom: For, as he afterward
wrote to the Lord Mayor and Common-Council
of <hi>London,</hi> he neglected not any
Maritime obſervations, which might be
uſeful to Engliſh Traffick, the ſlands
commodiouſneſs for Shipping &amp; Trade,
from the Eaſtern parts to the Weſt, in
the middle way between St. <hi>Malo</hi>'s, and
the River <hi>Seine,</hi> the capaciouſneſs of its
Harbour, together with the ſmaller
Iſlands, <hi>Alderneley, Lerke</hi> and <hi>Sarnia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, he betook himſelf to <hi>France,</hi>
to viſit his Mother in that Court, where
he was received with all imaginable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations
of Joy, where, after having
received his Mothers Bleſſing, and the
Complements of that Court, he retired
with her to the <hi>Louvre.</hi> But, his active
diſpoſition rendring him ſoon weary of
a tedious and eaſie Retirement, he deſired
leave of his Mother to go with the Duke
of <hi>Orleans</hi> into the Field that Summer in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57792:45"/>
the Head of a <hi>French</hi> Army, which then
marcht into <hi>Flanders</hi> againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi>
The Queen wrote to the King, to
know his pleaſure about it, but he abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
refuſed it, accounting it beneath
the Princes of <hi>Great Britain</hi> to ſerve
any, as thoſe who underſtood better how
to command, than be commanded, in a
Field, having formerly had Kings and
Emperours in pay under them; &amp; in regard
that our homebred miſeries afforded Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
ſo agreeable with his active
ſpirit, that he thought he ought not to
ſpare himſelf for any dangerous engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Foreign Quarrels, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
adviſed him to expect Inſtructions
from him how to diſpoſe of himſelf more
to his Kings, his Fathers, his own, and
Countreys Service.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, in obedience to his Royal
Fathers command, he quitted his own
wiſhes, and waited for farther directions
from the King. During which time, the

was recovered to ſo good a temper, as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57792:45"/>
to attend his Fathers Affairs, according to
thoſe Inſtructions he received from him
in an incloſed Commiſſion, which was

Whereupon the King wrote to him to

But, not ſatisfied therewith, they write to
him themſelves, by their Committee of

that none of the preſent Calamities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
his Fathers diſtreſs and reſtraint, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
them ſo much as his abſence; and,

               <p>But he had learned, by too ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
what faithleſs Truſtees they were

hazard Captivity, ſince all free-born Souls
embrace a Freedom, though it be but to
wander like forlorn Exiles in a ſtrange
Land, rather than a Reſtraint upon their
Perſons, their Judgments and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,

with patience till Providence might find
out ſome way for his return to his own
Country, with more Safety and Honour,
and ſent the Earl of <hi>Lauderdale</hi> back

That their Civility, which might

of thoſe Inſtructions he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

Treaty might be had in ſuch place
and manner as might conſiſt with the
Kings Honour, Safety and Freedom, that
ſo it might not be blemiſhed with any

might be included. 3. That in the mean

and an orderly moderate ſubſiſtance,
mutually agreed on for the Forces on

               <p>Wherefore ſeeing he could do nothing
by fair means, he applyed himſelf to
Force, and made ſeveral Honourable,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57792:48"/>
but unſucceſsful attempts, to reduce his
Rebellious Subjects to the obedience of
their Soveraign. <hi>Poyer</hi> and <hi>Langhorn</hi>

Tenby</hi> and <hi>Pembroke</hi> being ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
and <hi>Langhorn</hi> and <hi>Poyer</hi> forced to

wrote to St. <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> from the
<hi>Downs,</hi> where he then lay with his
Fleet, that they might have the uſage
and terms of Souldiers of War, as thoſe
had who were taken by him. To which
Letter the General anſwered with all due

in his power to Act further, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

dar'd not interpoſe their Juſtice; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SIRS, I received a Meſſage from you
for a Paſs, for ſome Gentlemen to come and
and Treat, according to an Order of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
but know of no ſuch Order of theirs,
or Authority of yours to appoint Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
for ſuch a purpoſe; &amp; finding you &amp;
them in Arms againſt the Parliament, I
cannot admit of a Treaty; but if ye ſhall
forthwith lay down your Arms, and return
home, I doubt not of the Parliaments mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to ſuch as have been deluded into this
Rebellion, and their Exemplary Juſtice to
the Chief Actors therein.</hi> Of which An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
having ſatisfied the Prince, they did
by directions from him make this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
1. That an univerſal and perpetual
Dictate of Nature, even ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not to invade others Rights, but to
ſecure their own, had drawn them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
2. 'Twas an undoubted Power over
them ordained of God they did then
obey, and ſo did neither Tumult nor
Rebel. 3. That Providence which had
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57792:49"/>
given them that opportunity, they dare
not neglect, nor could they lay down
their Arms without the forfeiture of
their Reaſon, and their Honour; and
that, as for the uncertain mercy which
he offered to the deluded many, whom
he thought knew not why they were
come together, &amp; the certain Juſtice he had
threatned their Leaders withal, he might
aſſure himſelf there was but one Soul in
that great Body, which was therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſtand or fall together as one
Man, being not tempted with any hope,
except that of returning to their ancient
Rights, Priviledges, Governments and
Settlements; and altogether uncapable of
any fear, ſave only that of relapſing into
their former ſlavery: And that the fair
managing of their buſineſs, was a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
demonſtration of their Inclinations
to Peace, entreating him therefore rather
to make the Country his Friend than
his Enemy.</p>
               <p>The General being inexorable, and
and they reſolved, both Armies met at
a barricadoed Bridge, between the
<hi>Heart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> and <hi>Graves-end,</hi> where both ſides
ſtrenuouſly diſputed the Paſſage, till the
Country-men retired back into their
main Body, being over-powered by
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57792:50"/>
multitudes, rather than overcome by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour;
whereupon (notwithſtanding they
gained another Paſs, which was diſputed
between them and the Parliamentarians)
they retired to <hi>Maidſtone,</hi> which they
ſtoutly maintained againſt the firſt and
ſecond, but yielded upon a third Aſſault,
though with a great ſlaughter of their
Enemies, who obtained that with great
loſs, which they parted with not without
extream regret; whereupon <hi>Rocheſter</hi> is
quitted, and left to the mercy of the
Enemy.</p>
               <p>In the mean time their General, the
Prince, lay in the <hi>Downs</hi> with his Fleet
in a very good condition, waiting for
that ſupply of Land Forces, which his
Brother the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly
raiſing for his Service in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and ſeizing ſeveral Merchant Ships
not to be releaſed under 200000 <hi>l.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
his Subjects future gain by that
preſent loſs, by employing of it in the
defence of their Laws and Liberties: But
underſtanding that the Caſtle of <hi>Deale</hi>
was in danger of being taken, he Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſome Forces for its Relief, who were
Vanquiſht almoſt as ſoon as Landed, a
Rebellion ſeeming to have chained the
Goddeſs Fortune, (as the <hi>Trojans</hi> did of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57792:50"/>
old) to its ſide. For it was ſo deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſucceſsful, that whenever it met
with Loyalty, it preſently vanquiſht
it.</p>
               <p>But, notwithſtanding this loſs, he
would have hazarded himſelf for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> wherein Sir <hi>Charles
Lucas</hi> and the Lord <hi>Capel</hi> with their <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi>-Forces
were beſieged, had he not
been diſſwaded by thoſe about him, and
informed that Coll. <hi>Scroop</hi> had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the relief of that City, with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
number of Men than was there under
his Command, whereupon he deſiſted
from his intention and reſerved his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
unblemiſhed Reputation, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
a fairer opportunity: And ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
at Anchor in the <hi>Downs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Fairfax,</hi> whoſe actions were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
as ſoon as thought, and whoſe
deſigns did almoſt prevent his perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
carried on the Siege of <hi>Colcheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
with ſo much ſtrictneſs and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that he very much ſtriatned thoſe
Valiant Worthies, who had ſomewhat
weakly impriſoned themſelves within a
place where they would be ſooner tired
than overcome, when it might have
been more diſcretion to have taken the
Field, and there have improved their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57792:51"/>
opportunity of performing ſomething
to the Honour of their Maſter, and
the good of their Country, by the glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thoſe Loyal Subjects, who would
have been continually reſorting to
them, and the taking all advantages
againſt their Enemy, or at leaſt they
might have died Nobly and revenged.
However they reſolved gallantly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the place to the laſt extremity,
their Valour being able to ſuffer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the Enemy without was able to
reduce them to; but Famine within be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a more prevailing Adverſary than
<hi>Fairfax</hi>'s Army; and when Courage
and Reſolution would not yield to the
one, Nature was forc'd to ſtoop to the
other. For their want of Proviſions were
ſo great, that Dogs and Cats were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
great Rarities, ſo that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
thought it a Relief to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
where he was moſt probable to
meet with death, as weary of the
lingring doom of departing by piece-meals,
and dying daily. Yet they yielded
not the City, till they were informed
of the <hi>Scots</hi> defeat at <hi>Preſton,</hi> and that
the Navy was revolted from the Prince
again, it being as unconſtant as the
Wind, and as unſtable as the Water
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57792:51"/>
that it ſailed upon: And indeed
what could be expected, but that thoſe,
who were Traitors to their firſt, ſhould
be unfaithful to their ſecond, Maſter?
And then thoſe Deſperado's reſolved
to make a general Sally upon the
Enemy; for ſince there now remained
no Calamity unſuffered, which they
could poſſibly fear; they thought it
was better to go forth and meet their
ſudden doom, than wait for it within
the Town; but the Souldiers and
Towns-men ſhrinking, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to yield themſelves to the General,
as Priſoners of War.</p>
               <p>His brave and War-like Attempts,
for his Fathers Reſtauration, having
thus proved unſucceſsful, he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to content himſelf with being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy,
ſince he had approved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be Loyal; and ſo he retired to
the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided
with his Siſter the Princeſs of
<hi>Orange,</hi> to avoid the Treachery of
Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who was dealt
withal to trapan him, and had for that
purpoſe, as himſelf ſaid, as much from
thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> as would maintain
the Queen and Princeſs, and defray
all the incident Charges which they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57792:52"/>
put that Kingdom to: As alſo to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
Suſpicion, which the Parliament
might have of him during the time of
the approaching Treaty. About which
having heard ſome uncertain Rumours,
he wrote to his Father by the Lord
<hi>Seymour</hi> for better ſatisfaction, that ſo he
might manage his Deſigns and Counſels
ſuitable to his Fathers Exigencies, as he
expreſt in his Letter, which was to this
purpoſe.</p>
               <p>SIR, Having no means to come to the
knowledge of your Majeſties Affairs, but
ſuch as I receive from the Prints, or
(which is altogether as uncertain) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
I have ſent this Bearer <hi>Seymour</hi>
to wait upon your Majeſty, and to bring
me an account of it; and that I may
alſo aſſure your Majeſty, that I do not
only pray for your Majeſty, according to
my duty, but ſhall always be ready to
do all which ſhall be in my power, to

beg of your Majeſty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And being now big with expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the joyful News of ſuch a ſetled
Peace, as might be ſafe and honourable
to his Majeſty, and advantagious to
the Subject, he receives Information
that the Treaty was begun, and ſo far
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57792:52"/>
concluded, on ſuch Reaſonable Demands
of the two Houſes, and Royal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions
of his Majeſty, as upon three
days mature deliberation it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that the King's Anſwer to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of both Houſes, was a ground
for them to proceed upon, for the

conſent; Who was in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto

himſelf, that his Majeſty having now,
in order to an accommodation, granted as
much as modeſty could ask, there would
undoubtedly follow a Peace and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Kingdom, with an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
ſatisfaction, and that the happineſs, and
not the error of the Government, were
ſome Mens grievances, which proved
but too true. For to ſuch a height wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and ſome other Officers of the Army,

gave it them, and to oppoſe themſelves

of the Kingdom; therefore find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that all the pretence of Authority
now failed them by the Parliaments Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57792:53"/>
to ſet the King at Liberty,
they now make uſe of plain Force, and
boldly adventure to contradict the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves
of the Parliament it ſelf, from
whom they had firſt received their
pretended Commiſſions, and preſume
without Law firſt to impriſon them in
their own Houſe, and then to ſequeſter
as many of them as they pleaſe from
coming thither. Whereby, having patcht
a <hi>Juncto</hi> of their own, which they ſtill
ridiculouſly called by the name of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
they renewed the Vote of <hi>Non</hi>-Addreſſes,
declare the Treaty at the
Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> diſhonourable and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
and therefore proteſt againſt
it, and then proceeded to diſarm the
City and Country, that ſo there might
not be a Sword drawn for the good
and Peace of the Kingdom. Which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles
being thus removed, the Army
encouraged the <hi>Juncto</hi> with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance,
wherein they propoſed
that the People ſhould agree finally
to take away the Government by
King, Lords and Commons, whereby
they made good thoſe Charges which
had formerly been made againſt the
Parliament, and their Army, and
from which they had endeavoured by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57792:53"/>
ſo many Oaths and Proteſtations to

in the name of the People, proceed
againſt all Malefactors, from the higheſt
to the loweſt, wherein they impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
included, and chiefly aimed at,
the King himſelf, who was in order
thereunto cloſely impriſoned, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
by them of the comfort of his
Loyal Attendants, and of the Honour
of that State and Ceremony that was
due to him.</p>
               <p>But theſe were but eſſays toward,
and beginnings of, Sorrows to that
Pious, though unfortunate King. Firſt,
It was moved in the Houſe on the firſt

might be tryed as a Traytor: Which hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
as well as ſenſeleſs, Vote was paſt

that, in regard the King was the
chief of the three States in Parliament,
he could not poſſibly be a Traytor to the
reſt, ſince Treaſon always goes upward,
and the loweſt only are capable of being
Traytors to the higheſt. Which Speech
the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> ſeconded by
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57792:54"/>
declaring his opinion, that ſuppoſe it was
without queſtion, that the King was
firſt in the War, yet they had neither
Law, Cuſtom or Preſident, to make that
War Treaſon in his Majeſty, and the
Lord <hi>Say</hi> affirmed that he knew not
who ſhould to ſay to Kings, <hi>Ye are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,</hi>
or to Princes, <hi>Ye are ungodly.</hi>
And Kings (added <hi>Pembroke)</hi> they ſay
can do no wrong, much leſs can they
be guilty of Treaſon, whereupon the
Ordinance was immediately thrown out
of that Honourable Houſe.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Juncto</hi> mad upon their ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and deſtructive project reſolved not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
that the Perſons, impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered
therein to try the King, ſhould
proceed accordingly, altho the Lords
conſented not. Which unexpected News
being brought the Prince by <hi>Seymour,</hi>
together with the Ordinance for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Tryal, he was thereby ſurprized
with ſo much Paſſion and Amazement, to
ſee their Oaths of Allegiance, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
Proteſtations, and Treaties for
Peace, conclude in Paricide and Murder,
that he knew not how to contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
until he began to conſider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that Paſſion muſt not be ſuffered to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57792:54"/>
diſturb reaſon in ſuch an exigency of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
wherein its conſultations were to
be imployed in the weighty buſineſs of
ſaving a Father, a King, and three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
and that it became him therefore
to give himſelf rather to diſcreet Advice
and Council, than to ſullen grief: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more Princely and Heroick, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the miſchief, than either to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
at it, or revenge it when it was done.
And in order thereunto he ſolicits <hi>Spain,
France, Holland,</hi> and the <hi>Scots,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
themſelves in his Fathers behalf,
who accordingly, by their reſpective Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
and Meſſengers, did mediate
for his Life, offering themſelves, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Peers, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Pledges for him. But the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Juncto</hi> were inexorable, their guilt
having made them ſo deſperate, that
they thought themſelves no otherwiſe
ſafe from former miſchiefs committed
by them, but by perpetuating a far
greater and unparallel'd wickedneſs, thoſe
Monſters of Men hurrying his Majeſty
from the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> to bring him to
his Tryal, as tho they had deſigned to
explain, to the wandring World, the
meaning of that Riddle, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in their pretence of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

him, whilſt they fought againſt
him.</p>
               <p>Being unjuſtly condemned by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
high Court of Juſtice, ſet up by
the <hi>Juncto</hi> for his Tryal, to loſe his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Head, he did upon the near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of his death take care, with good
<hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to ſet his Houſe in order,
giving charge concerning the ſame to
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſador, with whom he
was as private, as the rudeneſs of the
Souldiers would permit him. For the
moſt part of the <hi>Saturday</hi> in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
ordering him to carry his Bleſſing
to his Son, and deliver him ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
as equally declare the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our loſs in him, and our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in his Succeſſor, whoſe actions were
always ſteered according to them,
wherein he breathed more like an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel

The Devil of Rebellion can turn
himſelf into ſuch an Angel of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Old Serpent can pretend
ſuch New Lights, that when ſome
mens Conſciences accuſe them for Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Faction, they ſtop their mouth
with the name and noiſe of Religion.
When Piety pleads for Peace and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
they cry out Zeal; ſo that you
muſt be ſettled, or you ſhall never
want Temptations to deſtroy you and
yours. Men are ſo good at putting
the beſt of Princes for the worſt
of Deſigns, eſpecially when Novelty
prevails much, attended with Zeal for
Religion; and 'tis a good way to hide
their own Deformities, by ſevere cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
upon other mens Opinions and

               <p>Abet no publick Faction againſt your

Mens Hearts (who are prone to be of

who think themſelves and their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

               <p>Either calmly remove the ſeeming
differences and offences by impartiality,
or order it ſo in point of power, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57792:57"/>
you need not fear, or flatter any, elſe
you are undone, ſo quickly will the
Serpent devour the Dove. There is
leſs Loyalty, Juſtice, or Humanity in
none than in Religious Rebels, whoſe
Ambitious Policies march under the
Colours of Piety, with ſecurity and
applauſe. You may hear from them

               <p>The Presbyterian Faction in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

ſideing, as ill humors fall to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected

Novelty, adhere to that ſide as the moſt
remarkable note of difference (then)
in point of Religion; all leſſer Factions
(until time and ſucceſs had diſcovered to
them their ſeveral advantages) being
officious Servants to Presbytery.</p>
               <p>What may ſeem at firſt but an hand-breadth
in Religion, by Seditious Spirits,
as by ſtrong Winds, are ſoon made to
cover and darken the whole Heavens,
and therefore muſt be ſuppreſſed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>Next to your care for Religion take
care for Juſtice, according to the ſettled
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57792:58"/>
Laws of theſe Kingdoms, which by an
admirable temperament give very much
to the Subject, and yet reſerve enough
for any King, who owns his People as
Subjects, and not as Slaves.</p>
               <p>Never charge your Head with ſuch a
Crown, as may oppreſs the whole Body,
that it cannot return any ſtrength, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
or ſafety to the head.</p>
               <p>Your Prerogative is beſt exerciſed in
remitting, rather than exacting, the juſt
Vigour of the Laws.</p>
               <p>I hope you will never think it ſafe
for a King to gratify any Faction with the
perturbation of the Laws, in which is
wrapt up the publick intereſt, and the

               <p>My Counſel and charge to you is,
that (if it pleaſe God to reſtore you) you
ſeriouſly conſider the former real, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
miſcarriages, which might occaſion
my troubles, that you may avoid them.</p>
               <p>Never repoſe ſo much upon any Mans
ſingle fidelity, and diſtraction, (in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
affairs of Religion and Juſtice,) as
to create in your ſelf or others a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of your own judgment which will
prove more faithful to your own, and the
Kingdoms, intereſt than any Mans.</p>
               <p>Exaſperate no Faction by the aſperity
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57792:58"/>
of any Mans Paſſions, or humors (em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by you) about differences in leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
matters, wherein a charitable tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
diſſipates that ſtrength, whom
rougher oppoſition fortifieth; provided
the differences amount not to an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
oppoſition of Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
our Religion Eſtabliſhed, as to
the eſſentials of them.</p>
               <p>Always keep up ſolid Piety, and
thoſe fundamental Truths which mend
both the hearts and lives of men, with
impartial Favour and Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Take heed that outward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of Religion devour not all the
Encouragements of Learning, Induſtry
and Piety, but with an equal Eye, and
impartial Hand, diſtribute Favours and
Rewards to all men, as you find for
their real goodneſs, both in abilities
and fidelity, worthy or capable of
them. This will give you the hearts
of the beſt and moſt too, who, though
they be not good themſelves, yet are
glad to ſee the ſeverer ways of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

diſcover themſelves, which were at
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57792:59"/>
firſt wrapt up under the ſmooth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of Religion, Reformation and
Liberty. For, as the Wolf is not leſs
cruel, ſo he will be more juſtly hated
when he ſhall appear no better than a
Wolf under Sheeps clothing. And, as
for the ſecluded Train of the vulgar,
who, in their ſimplicity, follow thoſe
diſguiſes, my charge and counſel to
you is, That, as you need no pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for any Deſigns; ſo you ſtudy
really to exceed (in true and conſtant
demonſtrations of Goodneſs, Piety and
Virtue toward the People) even thoſe
men that make the greateſt noiſe and
oſtentation of Religion. So you ſhall
neither fear any detection, as they do
who have but the face and mask of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
nor ſhall you fruſtrate the juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of your People, who cannot
in reaſon promiſe themſelves ſo much
good from any Subjects Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as from the goodneſs of their
King. And when Factions are by God's
Mercy, and your Virtue, diſſipated, the
abuſed vulgar will then learn, that none
are greater Oppreſſors of their Eſtates,
Liberties and Conſciences, than thoſe
men that entitle themſelves, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
and Vindicators of them, only
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57792:59"/>
under that pretence, to uſurp Power
over them. Let no paſſion therefore
betray you to any ſtudy of revenge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe, whoſe own ſenſe and folly
will ſufficiently puniſh in due time.
But, as ſoon as the Forked Arrows of
Factious Emulations is drawn out, uſe
all Princely Arts and Clemency to heal
the Wounds, that the ſmart of the
Cure may not equal the ſmart of the
Heart.</p>
               <p>Where-ever it ſhall be deſired and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
offer Indempnity to ſo great a

to the Laws, as to remove all Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies,
not out of ſtrict Policy or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
but out of Chriſtian Charity and
Choice. For, be confident, (as I am)
that the moſt of all ſides that have done
amiſs, have done ſo, not out of malice,
but through a miſapprehenſion of things.
And that therefore none will be more
Loyal to you, than thoſe, who ſenſible
of their Errours, and our Injuries, will
feel in their Souls moſt vehement mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of Repentance, and earneſt deſires
to make ſome reparations for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

more conſcious you ſhall be to your

more prone you will be to expect all
Love and Loyalty from them; and by
inflicting no puniſhment for former

will give me and you that grace,
which will teach and enable us to
want, as well as to wear a Crown;
which is not worth the taking up or

               <p>May you be an Anchor of hope to
theſe weather-beaten Kingdoms, &amp; your
Wiſdom, Juſtice, Piety and Valour, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairer

of ſome men have ſo far ruined,
as to leave nothing intire to the Crown,
Nobility, Clergy or Commons, of Laws,
Liberties, Eſtates, Order, Honour, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
or Lives. Let thoſe that love
me find me (when I am gone) in your

do you perform, when God

God bleſs you, and eſtabliſh your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in Righteouſneſs, your Soul in

The good King, having thus reſigned
himſelf, and all his Affairs, into the
hand of God, patiently ſubmitted to his
Croſs; and in a way of renunciation, as
it were, and ſelf-diſpoſition of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
transferred and bequeathed
the Scepter, together with his Advice
and Direction, for his wielding of it.
He applied himſelf wholly to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
preparation for his departing from
an earthly to a heavenly Kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aſſiſted in his Piety and Devotion by
Dr. <hi>Juxon,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the fatal 30th of <hi>January</hi>
brought upon a Scaffold, erected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his own Palace of <hi>Whitehall,</hi> where
he was barbarouſly murdered by his
own Rebellious Subjects, he delivered
himſelf in the following Speech.</p>
               <p>Being not likely to be much heard, I
could be ſilent, did not ſilence intimate
a ſubmiſſion to the guilt as well as to
the puniſhment charged upon me. But
in my duty to my God and Country, to
clear my ſelf an Honeſt Man, a good
King, and a good Chriſtian, I proteſt
before God, to whom I muſt inſtantly
give an account, that (as may appear
from the date of their Commiſſions and
mine) I begun not the War againſt the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57792:64"/>
Parliament, nor intended I any incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon their Priviledges, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
with me and the <hi>Militia,</hi> which they
confeſt was mine, but thought it fit to
have it from me, yet I charge not the
guilt of theſe unhappy troubles upon the
two Houſes, for I believe ill inſtruments
betwixt us was the cauſe of all this
Bloodſhed, however this Sentence is juſt
<hi>upon me,</hi> for an unjuſt Sentence <hi>permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by me.</hi> What Chriſtian I am this good
Man, (pointing to Dr. <hi>Juxon)</hi> and others
that have been inwardly familiar with
me, and know me as well as my ſelf, may
bear witneſs. I die in Communion with
the Profeſſors of the Reformed Religion,
that hath been Eſtabliſht in the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> in Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> and my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
time of Bleſſed Memory, and in
Charity with all the World, forgiving
the worſt of mine Enemies, and praying
God that this be not laid to their Charge.</p>
               <p>As a good King I adviſe my Subjects,
not to ground your ſelves in Conqueſts
without a good cauſe, that you would
give God, the King, and the People their
dues. You may give God his due, by
the advice of a national Synod, freely
choſen and freely debating among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
How you may give the King his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57792:64"/>
due, the Law will inſtruct you, and the
People have their due, when they have
that Government and thoſe Laws,
whereby their Lives and Goods are moſt
their own. I have delivered my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
I pray God you take thoſe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
that may be for the Kingdoms and
your own good.</p>
               <p>Having finiſht this Speech and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth his Divine Soul to God in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
it was ſent by death to him that gave
it, where the great Aſſembly in Heaven
joyfully welcomed that Martyred King,
and made room for <hi>Charles</hi> of Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Life and Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the
firſt, being thus determined by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
and fatal ſtroak, his Eldeſt Son,
who likewiſe bore his Name, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
Succeeded him by the Title of
<hi>Charles</hi> the Second; Who was the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and undoubted Heir, not only of all
his Dominions, but alſo of his admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Heavenly Vertues, being endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with all thoſe Qualifications, which
are requiſite to, or could poſſibly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
in a Prince, and under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of whoſe happy Reign, theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
might have enjoyed as much happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and felicity as their Hearts would
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57792:65"/>
wiſh, had not their own folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for a time prevented it. For no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
had the Fatal Ax ſevered <hi>England</hi>
and her Liberties, by cutting off the
Head of her King, but the Parliament
(as the <hi>Juncto</hi> ſtill preſumed to call
themſelves) the better to cruſh Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
and maintain what they had now
ſo far proſecuted, iſſued forth a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
that none, under penalty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deemed guilty of High Treaſon,
ſhould preſume to Proclaim, declare,
publiſh or any way promote the Prince
of <hi>Wales,</hi> Son to the late King, or any
other Perſon whatſoever to be King, or
Chief Magiſtrate of <hi>England,</hi> or of any
part of the Dominions, or any part
thereof, by Colour of Inheritance, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
or Election, or any other claim
or pretence whatſoever without the free
conſent of the People in Parliament, and
which Proclamation, altho not publiſht
till the 2 of <hi>February,</hi> yet was in part
Proclaimed on the very day of the Kings
Murder.</p>
               <p>And for the more enſuring and the
better carrying on their Government
with the more plauſibility, they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
an Act of State, for the alteration of
Writs wherein inſtead of King, the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57792:65"/>
Name, Stile and Teſt, and <hi>Cuſtodes Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis
Angliae Anthoritate Parliamenti,</hi>
ſhould be uſed and no other: All Writs
being ordered to run ſo, and thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the Law required to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
thereof, yet they provided that all
Patents, granted by the late King, ſhould
ſtill ſtand in full force and vertue.</p>
               <p>And having caſt off the chief of thoſe
three Eſtates, by which the Nation had
been ſo long Governed, they think like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of aboliſhing the ſecond, that ſo
they might uſurp the whole power into
their own hands, in order whereunto
having firſt Voted that they would
make no farther Addreſſes to them nor
receive any from them, they made an
Ordinance for aboliſhing the Houſe of
Lords, as dangerous and uſeleſs. And
then having aboliſhed the Ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
of this Kingdom they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to the conſideration of Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
another, but found it a work of ſo
much intricacy that they could come
to no reſolution, but only agreed in a
Negative Voice that there ſhould, for
the future, be no Government in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
either by King or Houſe of Lords:
and thereupon ordered the old Great
Seal to be broken, and a new one to be
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57792:66"/>
made, which was delivered to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of three Commiſſioners, <hi>viz Keeble,
Whitlock</hi> and <hi>Liſly,</hi> and conſidered
of new Oaths to be adminſtred to the
Judges, who thereupon met and upon
debate ſix of them were contented to
continue in their Employments, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Fundamental Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
were not altered. For whoſe ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
the <hi>Juncto,</hi> by their Declaration
of the Ninth of <hi>February,</hi> did aſſure them
that they were fully reſolved to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and would uphold, preſerve and
keep, the Fundamental Laws of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for and concerning the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Laws, Properties and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the People, with all things incident
thereunto.</p>
               <p>They proceeded likewiſe to appoint
ſuch Perſons, as they thought would be
moſt firm to their Intereſt, to exerciſe
the Offices of Juſtices of the Peace
throughout the Nation, and conſtituted
a Council of State, conſiſting of about
forty in number, whereof five might be
Lords. And finally, to ſecure all, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they had before onely repealed, they
now aboliſh and make void, the Oath of
Allegiance and Supremacy.</p>
               <p>But, notwithſtanding all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57792:66"/>
to render themſelves ſecure and
firm in their Government, yet the
People began now to be generally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented:
And thoſe who had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected them, growing ſenſible of
the Inconveniencies that were like to
enſue upon the cutting off of their
Prince; beginning to abhor their practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
there was a general Plot carried on
againſt them in all the Counties of
<hi>England:</hi> Which obliged them to ſend
Forces into moſt parts, to awe them,
and thereby the better to keep them in
order. Notwithſtanding which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
of theirs, to bar up the way
to that Imperial Throne, which they
had impudently invaded, and parted
into ſhares amongſt themſelves, there
were ſome who had Courage and
Loyalty enough left them to aſſert
the King's Right, and their own Duty,
in a Printed Proclamation thrown about
the Streets. And to convince the <hi>Juncto</hi>
at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that all men would not
be wheedled to run a gadding after
their Calves at <hi>Bethel,</hi> but that there
were ſome ſtill left, who would tread in
the old Path, and beaten Tract of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
in the ſucceſſion of <hi>Charles</hi>
the Second to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:57792:67"/>
which Proclamation was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>We the Noblemen, Judges, Knights,
Lawyers, Gentlemen, Miniſters, Free-holders,
Merchants, Citizens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and

next Heir of the Blood Royal to his

               <p>Which Proclamation, although with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Solemnity, or indeed open Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
met with the ſame chearful
Reception, and inward Loyal Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as if Vent had been given to a
publick manifeſtation of Duty and Joy
by His Majeſties preſent aſcending the
Throne: For it revived the hearts of
his mourning and diſconſolate Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
to ſee the ſure and certain Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
thereof aſſerted and continued in
the ſame moſt beloved and darling
Name, the Eldeſt Branch, and deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their martyr'd Soveraign, in whoſe
Ruins the Regicides thought to have
rak'd up, and buried all Claims and Juſt
Titles to the Imperial Diadem of theſe

               <p>The ſaid Out-cries and lamentable

in <hi>Holland,</hi> where he then kept his

the horrour thereof ſo ſeized his great

that he ought not to ſorrow
as one without hope, buoyed up his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
and Reaſon forbid him to caſt away

the only hope of three Kingdoms.
Generous Rage prompting Princes to
Revenge, rather than Deſpair, which
was not to be accompliſht by weeping
Eyes, but by wiſe Counſels, and valiant
Performances.</p>
               <p>Wherefore he bravely cheered up, and
reaſſumed his wonted Courage, Comfort,
State and Majeſty. And for the better
managing of his Affairs, went ſoon after
to <hi>Paris,</hi> to ſolicit that Court to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
his Intereſt, and afford him ſome
Aſſiſtance for the recovery of his Right,
and the redreſſing his Subjects miſeries,
by diſcountenancing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rebels,
and furniſhing him with that compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
of Money, Men, Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,
which might enable him not to
Invade his Country, but to encourage his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57792:68"/>
own Subjects to reſcue themſelves from
a forced Slavery. But the <hi>French</hi> King
being under Age, and Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi>
who then governed the great Affairs of
that Kingdom, being no Friend to this ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
and diſtreſſed King, but holding a
correſpondence with his rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
he was able to procure no Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from thence. Whereupon he next
applied himſelf to <hi>Spain,</hi> whither he ſent
the Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> as his Embaſſador,
who upon his arrival there, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
by a Competitor, <hi>viz. Aſcham,</hi>
who called himſelf an Embaſſador from
the then New Majeſties of <hi>England,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he was diſpatcht by ſome <hi>Switz.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which <hi>Cottington</hi> was diſmiſt with
this Anſwer; That were it any thing in
the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s own Dominion,
which his Maſter of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> had
deſired, it ſhould have been no ſooner
requeſted than granted: But being a
Forreign Quarrel, he could not intereſt
himſelf therein, in regard it was not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
he ſhould buſie himſelf in other
mens matters, who had ſo many Irons
in the fire himſelf.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time, the Emperor,
the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Kings of
<hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> being acquainted
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57792:69"/>
with the preſent circumſtance of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
by his ſeveral Embaſſadors ſent to
each of them, they highly reſented his
deplorable condition, and reſolved his
ſpeedy aſſiſtance and ſupply. And <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
upon his Account, and the Intereſt
of his Siſter the Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> did
upon terms agreed on between the late
King and their Embaſſador, two days
before his death, reſolve not to vail to
this younger Siſters State, as they had
been wont to do to the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
but by the Forlorn of ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
acts of Hoſtility begin that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
which ſoon after brake out into
an open War. Nor was he altogether
void of Aſſiſtance from <hi>England,</hi> being
underhand ſupplied with ſome Moneys
by his Loyal Friends from thence.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Scotland</hi> was more entirely at his
Devotion, who having ſhewed their ſad
Reſentment of his Fathers Death, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
a Publick Faſt on that occaſion,
on the 19th of <hi>February,</hi> and chearfully
promoted his Succeſſion, by the Eſtates

His late Majeſty being, contrary to

               <p>Wherefore having hereby made the

to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> where he was received

in his paſſing the Gates with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery,
Ringing of Bells and all other
ſigns of Joy and Honour, and Noblely
treated by them. From whence he went
to <hi>Dort,</hi> where he was received in the
ſame manner, and then to <hi>Breda,</hi> and
then to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where, by order of the
Arch-Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> he was met and
entertained, with all poſſible ſtate and
ſplendor, being preſented likewiſe with
a rich Chariot, with eight Horſes, ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thereunto, and particularly welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his former Tutor, the Marqueſs
of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> (who had then fixt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence
there, out of reſpect to the great
Civility which he received from that
People, who had made him Exciſe-free,
and given him ſeveral other Immunities
and Priviledges.) And from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where he was as roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
entertained, &amp; with as much gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
as if he had been the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:57792:71"/>
himſelf. And the King did afterward
acknowledge that Entertainment for the
moſt ſumptuous and magnificent, and
to have in it the moſt pleaſing variety
of any that he ever met withal, during
the whole time of his Exile. Which Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitudes
were obſerved throughout his
whole paſſage: For at his departure
thence, the Duke of <hi>Lorrayn</hi> gave him
the like Entertainment, and conducted
him on his way toward <hi>France,</hi> where
in <hi>Compaign,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with the moſt and choiceſt of his
Nobility, did receive and welcom him
with all the Teſtimonies of Affection
and Honour that became ſuch a Prince,
and afterward conveyed him in State to
St. <hi>Germains,</hi> where the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then reſided.</p>
               <p>So that although he was baniſht from
his Throne, yet he wanted not a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
all men whereever he came,
being ſo taken with his Virtues, that
they ſeemed willing to become his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
Nor was his Court much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
in numbers and ſplendor, to thoſe
of other Princes, who were in the actual
poſſeſſion of their Crowns. Toward
the maintenance whereof, his Aunt the
Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> aſſigned him fifty
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57792:72"/>
thouſand Crowns <hi>per Annum;</hi> ſeveral
others contributing likewiſe thereunto,
according to their abilities.</p>
               <p>He was very much ſolicited about
this time by the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Commiſſioners,
to repair to that Kingdom; but finding
that the Conditions, upon which they
were willing to admit him, were ſuch as
he could not in honour accept of, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the parting with <hi>Montroſs,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſteer another courſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
grants a Commiſſion to <hi>Montroſs</hi> to
Levy what Forces he could beyond the
Sea, and with them go and joyn the
Lord <hi>Seworth,</hi> Major <hi>Straughan,</hi> and
others, who had got to Head for the King
without the Kirk, in the North of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
But they being routed before he
came by <hi>Liſley,</hi> and himſelf, not long after
his Arrival, defeated by a Party of the
Kirks Forces, and taken Priſoner, &amp; moſt
ignominiouſly hanged at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> he
was, as it were, forced by the neceſſity
of his Affairs, to comply with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
which was ſo much the eaſier
done, in regard, that, about that time
<hi>Montroſs</hi> was removed by an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
death. Wherefore he ſent Sir
<hi>Will. Fleming</hi> beforehand to complement
the States; he returned them his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

in the following Letter, which he

inſtructed for the concluding of a
Treaty with the King, who arrived at
<hi>Breda</hi> on the 16th of <hi>March,</hi> and were on
the 19th conducted by the L. <hi>Wentworth,</hi>
Maſter of the Ceremonies, to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
when they delivered to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
the following Propoſitions. 1. That
the Excommunicated ſhould be forbid
the Covenant. 2. That all the Acts of
Parliament be ratified, the Covenant ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the Presbyterian Government eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht
and practiſed in His Majeſties Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and elſewhere; and that he himſelf
ſwear to it. 3. That all Civill matters
might be determined by ſubſequent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and all Eccleſiaſtical matters by
the general Kirk aſſembled. Which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of theirs being delivered, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht
the Civil part of their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals,
from thoſe that concerned Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
matters, and told them, that as to
what concerned Civil Affairs, he would
confirm all the Acts and Ordinances of
the laſt Seſſion of their Parliament: And
that all Affairs concerning that Kingdom
ſhould be tranſacted in a Parliamentary
way, as they had been in his Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Grandfathers time. And that, as
long as any perſon did ſtand excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
he ſhould be uncapable of any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57792:73"/>
or place of truſt in that Nation. And,
as to what concerned the Eccleſiaſtical
matters, he told them, That the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
ſeemed more proper for Subjects,
than for a King, in regard Allegiance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Soveraignty was a conſiderable part
of it. And that as to thoſe parts of it,
wherein he thought himſelf concerned,
he would, upon the word of a Prince,
with the limitation allowed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<hi>viz.</hi> as far as he did, or might in
his Conſcience, according to the Word of
God, endeavour in his place the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in Religion and Worſhip, in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Aſſuring
them moreover, that he would allow the
<hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation a Liberty as large as he
enjoyed himſelf; And that in caſe the
generality of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
in Parliament, would propoſe unto
him the Presbyterian Government as the
way wherein that Nation would walk in
fellowſhip with God, he would confirm
and eſtabliſh it by his Royal Authority.
And finally, That in order to his making
good thoſe particulars, he would, with
all convenient ſpeed, repair to his Ancient
Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> deſiring to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed,
if his Fathers, and his own ancient
and faithful Friends, who had conſtantly
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57792:74"/>
attended on him in all his ſufferings,
ſhould come along with him thither,
ſince he could not, in point of gratitude,
diſcharge thoſe from the Advantages of
Loyalty, whoſe faithfulneſs to him was ſo
great, that no hazards whatſoever, could
diſcharge them from the Services, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
and Dangers of it; telling
them, he ſhould be a King in vain, if
Allegiance in his Court were eſteemed a
fault that deſerved caſhiering.</p>
               <p>Theſe Propoſals and Anſwers were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
debated by Commiſſioners on
both ſides, the <hi>Scots</hi> ſtanding very ſtifly
to their Principles, and the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
reſolved not to yield to all
their demands, whereupon by an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had upon ſome
of the Commsſſioners (for they had
their Active Agents both their and in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> ſtreneouſly endeavouring to
countermine the honeſt endeavours of all
ſides for pacification) the treaty was
like to break off as unhappily as by them
it was thought to be begun, but by the
mediation of the States General, the
Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>
it was reaſſumed, and brought to
a Concluſion, upon the Covenant Terms
on the Kings part, with the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57792:74"/>
limitation, it was the Religious
part of the Treaty which kept them at
the greateſt diſtance, and was the moſt
difficult to be agreed upon, controverſies
of that nature being ever the moſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable,
the civil part ever quickly
diſpatcht in regard he was of ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending
temper that conld content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
quit much of his intereſt for the
Peace, and welfare of his People, but
was unwilling to quit any of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
which he knew to be a far more
weighty and ſacred matter.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>Scots</hi> ſide it was agreed that
his Majeſty ſhould be admitted to the
Throne of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and his juſt Rights
in that Kingdoms recovered by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
from the hands of thoſe who had
uſurpt them, and that they ſhould aſſiſt
his Majeſty in bringing the Murderers
of his Royal Father, to condign puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
reſtore him to the Kingdom of
<hi>England,</hi> and the vindicating his Right
thereunto againſt the preſent Uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Treaty being thus finiſht, the
Commiſſioners both of the Kirk and
the State were ſplendidly treated by the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and highly honoured
by his Majeſty, after which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57792:75"/>
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> exceedingly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in their ſucceſs and entertainment.</p>
               <p>Nor were the <hi>Scots</hi> alone in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
at this time, to reſtore His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
to his loſt Dominions: For many
of the Presbyterians in <hi>England,</hi> did
likewiſe, by their Agents at <hi>B<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>da,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
all their Intereſt for the promotion
thereof. But <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Emiſſaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo thick, that three could ſcarcely
meet together, but one of them would,
in the end, prove his Spie, they were
betrayed, and their Deſigns came to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Many eminent perſons, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of their Miniſters, being taken and
brought to Tryal, as <hi>Caſe, Jenkins, Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Love,</hi> and others; ſome whereof
were executed, (upon the importunity of
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> who proteſted to the <hi>Juncto,</hi>
that if they did not Juſtice in <hi>England,</hi>
he would not fight in <hi>Scotland,)</hi> viz. <hi>Love</hi>
and <hi>Gibbons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Juncto</hi> were very much allarum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when they underſtood, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
all their Endeavours to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the Treaty at <hi>Breda</hi> is concluded.
And that among other things, the <hi>Scots</hi>
had engaged to aſſiſt His Majeſty to
bring them, and the Rebels of their
Conſpiracy, to condign pnniſhment, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57792:75"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o recover thoſe Rights, which none but
ſuch Monſters as themſelves would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
detain from ſo great, and ſo good
a Prince. Wherefore being deeply ſenſible
of their danger, they prepare for War, but
whether it ſhould be Offenſive or Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
was yet a queſtion among them.
But at laſt conſidering that, if there muſt
be a War, it had ever been a Maxim
among the greateſt Politicians, that it
was moſt prudent to make the Enemies
Country the Seat of it. They reſolved
upon an Offenſive War, hoping that
<hi>Scotland</hi> would quickly be weary of
maintaining two Armies, ſince it had
ſo much ado to keep one. And that
ſince they were informed their Levies
went on flowly, they thought that
their Forces, which were already on
Foot, might eaſily go and ſurprize
them, before they lookt for them,
or were half ready to entertain
them.</p>
               <p>In order whereunto, <hi>Cromwel</hi> being
called out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was in great ſtate
made Captain General of all their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
raiſed, or to be raiſed in <hi>England,
Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Lord <hi>Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax,</hi>
who had in him ſome ſparks of
Loyalty, waving at once that Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57792:76"/>
and his own Commiſſion; not as
ſome imagine, to avoid the hazard of
that Expedition; for he was one that
never turned his back upon danger, but
becauſe he was unwilling any longer to
be ſubſervient to thoſe baſe and vile
Deſigns, which he now began to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe preparations were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in <hi>England,</hi> the King removed
from the <hi>Hague</hi> to <hi>Diep</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi>
and from thence to <hi>Scheveling;</hi> from
whence, after a dangerous Storm, and
narrow eſcape of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels,
which lay in wait for him, he arrived
ſafe at the <hi>Spey</hi> in the North of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which the Parliament being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of, they ſent ſome Lords to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and attend him from thence to
<hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where he is received by
the Parliament and Committee of
Eſtates and Kirk, with infinite expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Fidelity and Affection; the
common people like ſo many Echoes
to their Superiors; and the whole Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſounding nothing but <hi>Vive le Roy.</hi>
But <hi>Cromwel,</hi> being advanced with
his Army into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and having
been ſucceſsful in ſome ſmaller Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and given them a total overthrow
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57792:76"/>
at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> they found themſelves in a
ſad and perplexed condition, having
not only the Enemy raging in the
bowels of that Kingdom; but being
extreamly divided alſo amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
wherefore they now thought it
high time to unite among themſelves.
In order whereunto a general meeting
was appointed at St. <hi>Johnſtons,</hi> which
ſhould conſiſt of King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and the Aſſembly of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
in which Aſſembly ſeveral Lords
formerly in favour with the Kirk,
were admitted to Commands in the
Army, and a Liberty to ſit in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as <hi>Hamilton, Lauderdale,</hi> and
others. And Major General <hi>Maſſey,</hi>
formerly Governour of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> for
the Parliament, but afterward reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to the King, was admitted to a
Command in the Army. And as the
perfection of all the Kings Coronation
was there reſolved upon, ſo that now
their wounds began to heal, and their
breaches to be made up again; and it
was generally hoped, that theſe Clouds
of Diviſion being blown over, a ſerene
Sky would immediately follow, and
the Sun of Proſperity ſhine on their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
proceedings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:57792:77"/>
The Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of thoſe reſolutions at St. <hi>Johnſtons,</hi>
having diſſolved themſelves in order to
the Kings Coronation, it was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the firſt of <hi>January</hi> at <hi>Schone</hi> in
as Solemn and Splendid manner, as the
exigency of the time could bear; his
Majeſty with a great Train of his Nobles
and others went firſt to the Kirk, where
a Sermon was Preacht by a Scotch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
whoſe name was <hi>Duglaſs,</hi> upon
thoſe words, <hi>then they brought out the
Kings Son, and put upon him the Crown,
and gave him the Teſtimony, and made
him King, and</hi> Jehojadah <hi>and his Son
Anointed him, ſaying,</hi> God ſave the King.
2 Chron. 23, 11. Joined to theſe words,
<hi>and</hi> Jehojadah <hi>made a Covenant between
all the People, and between the King, that
they ſhould be the Lords People, v.</hi> 16.
Which Sermon being ended he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
from his Chair of State, which
was placed in the Kirk, to that erected
for his Coronation, by the Lord High
Conſtable, and the Earl Marſhal, where
being placed he was Proclaimed King by
Herald King at Arms; and then clad
with a Robe of State by the Lord Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain,
and the Lord Steward. After
which ſitting he conſented to the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57792:77"/>
Covenant, the Solemn League, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
Directory, and the Catechiſms,
and promiſed upon his Royal word to
perform them (ſo far as he underſtood
them to be agreeable to the Word of
God,) in his own Family in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in all his other
Dominions, as ſoon as it ſhould pleaſe
God to reſtore him thereunto: Which
being done, the Coronation Oath was
next read, which was Enacted in the
firſt Parliament of King <hi>James,</hi> and is as
follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That His Majeſty ſhall maintain
that Religion, Diſcipline and Worſhip,
that is moſt agreeable to the Word of
God, to the beſt Patrons of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and is againſt all Hereſy, Schiſm,
Idolatry, Superſtition and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that he ſhould govern the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by Law and Equity, and that he
ſhould maintain the juſt Rights of the
Crown, and Priviledges of the People.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After the reading of which Oath he
declared with an audible Voice, that he
did promiſe, in the name of the great
God who Lives for ever, that he
would to the uttermoſt of his Power,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57792:78"/>
endeavour to do the things contained in
that Oath. Which done, Herald King
at Arms went to the four corners of
the Stage, and demanded of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
four times, whether they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
that <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, Son and
Heir of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, ſhould be King
over them, to which the People an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>Long live King Charles, God
Save the King.</hi> Then the Marqueſs of
<hi>Argile</hi> Preſented him with the Royal
Scepter, the Earl of <hi>Eglington</hi> put on
the Spurs, the Lord High Conſtable ſet
the Crown upon his Head, and the
Earl Marſhal having unſheathed the
Sword, put it into his hand to defend
the Faith withal, which having held a
while, he delivered it to the Earl of
<hi>Glencarn</hi> to be carried before him.</p>
               <p>Then the Nobility, Gentry and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
of the Kingdom, did as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Great God that Lives for
ever ſwear Allegiance, Fealty and
Obedience, to him as to their Liege and
Soveraign Lord; and the whole Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
was concluded, by an Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Miniſter to his Majeſty, to
the Nobility, to the Clergy, and to the
Commons, the ſum and ſubſtance
whereof, was in reference to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57792:78"/>
which they then lookt upon as
the Center from which every Line,
both of Soveraignty, and the Subjects
Duty, was to be drawn in their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Circumſtances. And for a power
to perform what he then exhorted
them to, the aſſiſtance of God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
by prayer; who being <hi>Alpha</hi>
and <hi>Omega,</hi> they made him the firſt
with whom they began, and the laſt
with whom they finiſhed. So ſoon as
the Crown was ſet upon his Head, he
made a ſhort, but pithy Speech to the
People, telling them, that he did eſteem
the Affections of his good People, more
than the Crowns of many Kingdoms,
and ſhould be ready, by God's Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
to beſtow his Life for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
wiſhing to live no longer than
he ſaw Religion and that Kingdom to
flouriſh in all Happineſs; with many
other expreſſions of like Love and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
toward them.</p>
               <p>The Ceremonies of the Coronation
being ended, and a plentiful Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
prepared, he ſate down at one
Table, and the Lords at another, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Careſſes and Teſtimonies of Joy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally

Dinner being ended, they all returned

they had of Happineſs and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
under the Influence of his mild
and eaſie Government.</p>
               <p>Having now obtained the actual
poſſeſſion of one of his Kingdoms;
and being reconciled to that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he was not in the leaſt daunted
by the late Miſcarriages, but as if he
had been encouraged by his former
Unhappineſs, and raiſed in mind like
<hi>Anteus</hi> by his Fall, he proceeded to
the raiſing of ſuch an Army, as might
then have been rather wiſht for by the
Affectionate, than expected by the
Reaſonable. And indeed ſuch was the
Confluence of Faithful Subjects, that
continually reſorted to him, and were
reſolved to carry on, and, if poſſible,
maintain an endangered, and an endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
Cauſe againſt the moſt ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and hitherto prevailing Intereſt,
that he was in a little time Maſter
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57792:79"/>
of a greater Army in the Field, than
either his own hope, or his Enemies
guilty fear, could ſuſpect. Wherefore
he bravely appears himſelf in the
management of his own Affairs, as
<hi>Generaliſsimo</hi> of that Army, which
conſiſted of two and twenty thouſand
fighting Men.</p>
               <p>Nor was his care leſs employed
about his Garriſons, than it was about
thoſe Forces he had in the Field,
knowing that it was prudence to
provide for a Retreat, though he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
a Conqueſt, and not neglect
the providing a Refuge in the worſt
of Dangers; whilſt, according to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
he need to think of nothing but
Safety in the beſt of Victories.
Wherefore to haſten the work, for
every minute of delay was then fatal,
and cheriſh the dejected Vulgar, (who
were now ſomewhat diſcouraged by
lying under the burden of a double
Army,) with the honour and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of his gracious preſence: He
took a progreſs to view the moſt
conſiderable of them, and ſee them
well fortified and furniſht with all
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57792:80"/>
neceſſary Proviſions, encouraging the
Engineers by his Bounty, and directing
and guiding them by his Skill.</p>
               <p>But thoſe vaſt Preparations were too
formidable to his Enemies for them
to ſuffer 'em to go on without an
Attempt, at leaſt, to hinder and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
them. Wherefore, before the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies
were well compleated, <hi>Cromwel</hi>
makes hard toward him, thinking
each minute tedious that paſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome Action. But the King pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
declined joyning Battel with
him, until he might, if poſſible, draw
him, (who had a greedy deſire of
Fighting,) into ſome diſadvantage,
which he was in a probability of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſoon after. For <hi>Cromwel,</hi> having
commanded two Regiments to paſs
over into a narrrow Iſland, hoping
thereby to intercept his paſſage, he
ſent againſt them five or ſix Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
under the Command of Major
General <hi>Brown,</hi> who had certainly cut
them all in pieces, had not <hi>Cromwel</hi>
haſtened thither with a ſupply in the
very laſt minute of opportunity,
whereby he reſcued his own Forces,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57792:80"/>
and beat back <hi>Brown,</hi> although not
without a conſiderable loſs on both
ſides. And, being fluſht with thoſe
ſucceſsful beginnings, purſued his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
and tranſporting his Army
over <hi>Fife,</hi> marcht immediately unto
St. <hi>Johnſtons,</hi> which he took almoſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the firſt Summons.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the King, who was not
able to beat them back, thought it
high time to look about him. And,
ſince <hi>Cromwel,</hi> that ſucceſsful Rebel,
had now gained all on the other ſide
<hi>Fife,</hi> took the Earl of <hi>Eglington</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
poſſeſt himſelf of St. <hi>Johnſtons,</hi>
and grew every day more powerful,
he reſolved, with all imaginable ſpeed,
to advance into <hi>England,</hi> expecting
that the Juſtice and Equity of his
Cauſe, together with the long Tyranny
exerciſed over them by the <hi>Juncto,</hi>
would incite his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects to
return to their Allegiance, and joyn
with him againſt theirs, as well as
his Enemies. And knowing by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that the <hi>Scots</hi> always expreſt
their Valour better in other Countries,
than at home, in their own; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57792:81"/>
                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> re-croſſes <hi>Frith,</hi> and
ſends <hi>Lambert</hi> with a ſelect Party of
Horſe and Dragoons, to fall upon the
King's Reer, himſelf following pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
after with the Body of his Army.
The King entred <hi>England</hi> by the way
of <hi>Carliſle;</hi> the Royal Army march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through the Country with that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
and exact Obedience to Military
Diſcipline, that, as ſome affirm, the
Country was not damaged ſix-pence
by them. But whether it were, that
their former Villanies had left ſuch a
deep impreſſion in the hearts of the
People; or that they were now dull'd
and beſotted with Slavery, and with
<hi>Iſſachar</hi>'s Aſs, were content to couch
under their Burdens, or that they were
over-awed by an Armed Power, which
is the moſt probable, few or none
came in to his Aſſiſtance, ſave only
the Lord <hi>Howard</hi>'s Son of <hi>Eſcrick,</hi>
with one Troop of Horſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his earneſt Invitation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Juncto</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> hearing
of the King's March, were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
terrified therewith, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
raiſed all the Countries againſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57792:81"/>
him, and declared it High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for any to aſſiſt him either with
Men, or Money.</p>
               <p>But the Earl of <hi>Darby,</hi> who was
always Loyal both to him and his
Father, not fearing their Bug-Bear
Threatning, brought him a ſupply of
Two hundred and fifty Foot, and
Sixty Horſe, out of the <hi>Iſle of Man.</hi>
He met with no oppoſition till he
came at <hi>Warrington</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi>
where ſome conſiderable Forces of the
Parliament were ready to cut down
that Bridge, and diſpute his Paſſage:
But the <hi>Scots</hi> falling on them, before
they were aware, prevented the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down of the Bridge, and by
their Valour, forced their way over
the Planks, and put the Adverſary to
ſuch a confuſed Retreat, that had it
been purſued, as himſelf would have
had it, but was oppoſed by <hi>Leſly,</hi>
it might have proved the Conqueſt
of all <hi>England;</hi> and that unhappy
and miſerable War might thereby
have been ended much ſooner than
it was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:57792:82"/>
From thence he marched toward
<hi>Worceſter,</hi> in ſuch excellent Order, and
with ſo little Damage to the Country,
that it lookt more like a Progreſs
with his Nobles, than a March with
an Army; which was a great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the powerful Influence of
his goodneſs and care, which could
ſo eaſily frame Rudeneſs it ſelf to
ſo ſmooth and even a temper, and
form an unruly Camp into a well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
and orderly Court.</p>
               <p>In his way to <hi>Worceſter</hi> he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
<hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> by a Letter direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Collonel <hi>Mackworth,</hi> Governour
thereof, which was wholly compoſed
of bowels, compaſſion and clemency,
ſignifying to him, that being ſenſible
of the injury done; and now, for a
long time, continued to him in the
unjuſt Uſurpation of his Rights, and to
his People, in the frequent and horrid
breaches of their Priviledges, he was
willing to do himſelf and them ſo
much Right, as to endeavour the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of his and their Rights, which
he, both by his peculiar Inclination,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57792:82"/>
and his Intereſt, was more willing to
do by Peace and Reaſon, than by War
and Force, and therefore willed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
him to deliver up his Charge,
and thereby prevent all Violence, which
he conjured him to do as he was a
Subject, a Chriſtian, and a Gentleman.
To which the Governour in a Reply, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by him to the Commander in
Chief of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Forces then in
<hi>England,</hi> anſwered, That he could not,
as a Chriſtian, Gentleman, or Subject,
betray the Truſt his Superiors had put
him in, ſo far as to deliver that place
to any perſon without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>Being come to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> he made a
a halt, and marcht his Army into that
City, which was certainly a very great
overſight, and proceeded from his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
himſelf to be unhappily prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon (as his Father had too often
been,) by the light Reaſons of others,
more than by thoſe that were far more
weighty of his own. For if he had marcht
directly to <hi>London,</hi> he had certainly
been ſucceſsful, and would have ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
that great City, before they had
been in a condition to have defended
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57792:83"/>
themſelves. On which, the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
would conſequently have ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him. So that thoſe, who adviſed
him to ſtay at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> ſeem to have
accounted a few days March too great
a purchaſe for three Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Darby,</hi> who was left in
<hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> to raiſe more Men in that,
and the adjacent Countries, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
by <hi>Lilburn,</hi> with his own,
and the General's Regiment, was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown
and routed: So that he nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
eſcaped with ſome few only to
the King at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who was now
as cloſely coopt up in that City, by a
company of fortunate Rebels, as the
King of <hi>France</hi> was at <hi>Agincourt,</hi> by
our brave King <hi>Henry;</hi> the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being about him, rather to ſwallow
him up by their multitudes, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
him by their Valour. To whom
<hi>Cromwel</hi> at laſt comes, as a <hi>Genius</hi> to
quicken them to action, who had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
done nothing but look on,
and ſpirit their grave and ſlow ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
into a fierce Aſſault, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Storm. The King, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to defend the City as long as
poſſible againſt his powerful Attaques.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57792:83"/>
The firſt whereof was the diſputing of
a Poſtage over the <hi>Severne,</hi> called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Bridge,</hi>
by <hi>Lambert,</hi> which had
been utterly impoſſible for him to have
gained, had not either Negligence or
Treachery, in thoſe appointed by the
King, to break it down, left one Plank
behind, which reach'd from Arch, to
Arch, a ſmall Party of Horſe and Foot,
ſent by him, under the Command of
<hi>Fleetwood,</hi> to judge of the feaſibleneſs
of the Attempt, finding a Plank left
upon the Bridge, immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted,
and ventured over, ſecuring
themſelves in a Church, on the other
ſide; which <hi>Moſley</hi> (who lay in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton,</hi>
with about Two Hundred Horſe, and
Sixty Dragoons, in abundance of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and without the leaſt dread of an
enemy) alarumed with aſſaults, whilſt in
the mean time <hi>Lambert</hi> paſs'd over a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Party of Horſe to their relief;
upon which <hi>Moſley</hi> finding it was then
in vain to fight, made an honourable
Retreat toward <hi>Worceſter,</hi> himſelf ſtill
bringing up the Rear, in which Service
he was wounded by a ſhot in the head.</p>
               <p>The Bridge being thus gain'd, was
immediately repaired, and <hi>Lamberts</hi>
Army paſt all over, whilſt <hi>Cromwell</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:57792:84"/>
upon a Bridge of Boats, which he cauſed
to be made over the <hi>Severne,</hi> on the
other ſide, march'd over with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
under his Command, whereby
the City of <hi>Worceſter</hi> was very much
ſtrait'ned. There happened, for a day or
two after this, ſeveral ſmall Engagements
with very doubtful ſucceſs, until Victory
hovering, as it were, between the equal
rivals, doubtful which head to Crown
with Conqueſt, until <hi>Cromwell,</hi> rowſing
up his accuſtomed Spirit of diſpatch,
appeared at <hi>Red-Hill,</hi> and reſolved to
attack the City on all ſides, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Fleetwood</hi> to make the Attack
on one ſide, whilſt he himſelf under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to manage it on the other: Which
the King perceiving, from the top of
the Church Steeple, where he then
held a Council of War, the better to
diſcern the Poſture of the Enemy;
ordered ſome to draw out from St.
<hi>John</hi>'s, to oppoſe <hi>Fleetwood,</hi> others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſent in the mean time to line the
hedges in <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s way, who play'd
their part ſo bravely, that <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s
Red-coats were at firſt glad to retire,
until reinforc'd with freſh Soldiers.
But then they were forc'd to retire,
Whereupon the King himſelf march'd
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57792:84"/>
with incredible Reſolution out of <hi>Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
Gate, with a good Train of horſe
and foot to oppoſe <hi>Cromwell,</hi> whoſe
invincible Life-guard, which was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called Iron-ſides, becauſe it was
cuſtomary to them to conquer, were
very much diſordered, the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
ſuch wonders as were almoſt
above belief; exerciſing the part both
of a couragious General and a valiant
Soldier, having his horſe twice ſhot
under him, and rallying the diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Infantry, in his own Perſon, till
they were utterly loſt by the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of <hi>Leſley,</hi> who ſordidly ſuffered
a brave body of Horſe to ſtand ſtill, and
look on the ruin of their King and
Country-men, unrevenged, and as it
were, patiently wait for their own.</p>
               <p>The Field being now loſt, he was
forced to Retreat into the City, with
the loſs of Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Sir <hi>John
Douglaſs,</hi> and ſeveral other perſons of
note; being obſerved that he, like <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
did that day never bid his Soldiers <hi>go,</hi>
but <hi>come,</hi> and that as he went firſt into
Field, ſo he returned the laſt from it;
being not without ſome difficulty, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
to retire, whereby it appeared
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57792:85"/>
he was not Conquered, but Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered.</p>
               <p>In vain did he ride among the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
Soldiers, with his hat in his
hand, intreating them to ſtand to their
Arms, and telling them, when he
could not prevail, that he had rather
they would Shoot him, than keep him
alive to ſee the ſad effects of that fatal
day; for the Conquerors purſued the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
<hi>Scots</hi> to the Town, with ſuch fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that they even tired themſelves with
Slaughter and Execution, and became
weary of Conquering, fighting now,
not ſo much againſt any other, as againſt
the King himſelf, who was now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the only care both of his Friends
and Enemies: the one crying, <hi>Save
the King,</hi> for whom they were more
concerned than for themſelves, and the
other crying out with as much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<hi>Where is the King?</hi> as if he had
been the only prize they fought for.</p>
               <p>About ſix in the Evening, ſeeing all
irrecoverably loſt, he March'd out at
St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s Gate, leaving all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
as a Prey to the Enemy; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they were well loſt, ſince by their
loſs he redeemed himſelf: for he was
no ſooner got out on one ſide, but the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57792:85"/>
Enemy preſt in on the other to look for
him, and had certainly purſued and
overtaken him, had they not been ſtop'd
by the Royal ſpoil which was left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
to the ſame purpoſe that <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame</hi>
left behind her the Golden Apples
to tempt the Purſuer to ſtay the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them up, and thereby ſave herſelf.
And the Valour of ſome that ſtill kept
the Royal Fort, to reduce whom, <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
commanded out ſome <hi>Cheſhire</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who moſt of them periſhed in the
attempt, that County having never
before loſt ſo many lives in ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
Service; but having at laſt
made himſelf Maſter of it, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
were all put to the Sword:
whereupon the remainder of the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
craved Quarter, and had it rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>From this unfortunate Battel not
above 300 Horſe, and ſcarce any of the
Infantry, eſcaped, who were moſt of
them either ſlain or taken, near 100
Priſoners of Quality; of which, the

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale,

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57792:86"/>
many more: the number of the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the whole, being ſaid to be 10000,
together with whom, was taken the
King's Standard, Coach and Horſes,
Collar of SS's and Star-Cloth. Major
General <hi>Maſſey,</hi> who eſcaped the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
not knowing where to ſhelter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
being grievouſly wounded, was
forced to ſurrender himſelf a Priſoner
likewiſe to the Counteſs of <hi>Stamford,</hi>
being ſecured by the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi>
her Son, by whom he was, after
the recovery of his Wounds, ſent up to
<hi>London,</hi> from whence, not long after,
he made his eſcape. The news of this
Victory extreamly rejoyced the Juncto,
but the joy for their Victory was ſome,
what allayed by the King's eſcape.</p>
               <p>Before he was got as far as <hi>Barbone</hi>'s
Bridg, which was not above half a Mile
from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> he made ſeveral ſtands,
facing about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and deſiring the Duke of
<hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Lord <hi>Wilmot,</hi> and
other of his Commanders, that they
might rally with thoſe few Forces that
were yet left him, and once more try
the fortune of War. But being come
to the Bridg, a ſerious Conſultation was
held about it; when perceiving many
of the Troopers throwing off their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57792:86"/>
Arms, and ſhifting for themſelves, their
opinion was, that the day was ſo irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably
loſt, that his only buſineſs
now, was to endeavour the ſaving of
himſelf from thoſe ravenous Wolves
and Regicides; whereupon he reſolved,
by the advice of his Council, to March
back again for <hi>Scotland:</hi> and in order
thereunto, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>
demanded of the Lord <hi>Talbot,</hi> who was
of that Country, if he could not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
them in their way <hi>Northward,</hi>
who thereupon anſwered, that he had
in his Troop one <hi>Walker,</hi> formerly a
Scout-Maſter in thoſe Parts, that knew
the way very well; who being accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
called to be their Guide, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that duty well enough for ſome
Miles: but coming to <hi>Kinven</hi> Heath,
not far from <hi>Kiderminſter,</hi> he was at a
loſs, and knew not which way to go.
Whereupon the King made a ſtand, and
conſulted with the Lords, whither he
might with moſt ſafety March to take
ſome hours reſt, being almoſt quite worn
out and ſpent: The Earl of <hi>Darby</hi> told
him that, in his flight from <hi>Wiggan</hi>
to <hi>Worceſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> he had met with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
honeſt Man, and a great conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of concealment at <hi>Boſcobel</hi> Houſe;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57792:87"/>
whereupon he reſolved to repair thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Mr. <hi>Charles Gifford,</hi> who ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well knew the way, was appointed
to conduct him thither. When they
came near <hi>Stunbrigde,</hi> it was debated
by them, whether they ſhould march
through the Town or not; and being
concluded in the affirmative, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
that thoſe about the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſhould ſpeak nothing but <hi>French,</hi>
thereby the better to prevent the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of his being there: <hi>Leſley</hi> having,
with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Horſe, in the cloſe of
the Evening, taken a more direct way
<hi>Northward</hi> by <hi>New-Port,</hi> he was now
left attended only by <hi>Buckingham, Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
Lauderdale, Talbot, Wilmot,</hi> and a
few other Gentlemen, being in all not
above ſixty Horſe. At a Houſe about a
Mile beyond <hi>Stunbridge,</hi> he refreſh'd
himſelf a little with ſome ſmall Beer
and a cruſt of Bread, the Houſe afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no better Proviſion; and as he rode
forward, he diſcourſed with Colonel
<hi>Roſcarrock,</hi> about the conveniency of
<hi>Boſcobel</hi> Houſe, and the means of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which he and the Earl of <hi>Darby</hi>
had found there. <hi>Gifford</hi> humbly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
to carry him firſt to <hi>White-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
a Houſe about half a Mile beyond
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57792:87"/>
                  <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> belonging to one <hi>Fitz-Herbert,</hi>
where he might repoſe himſelf a while,
and then take ſuch farther reſolution as
he and his Council ſhould think fit:
which was accordingly reſolved on.
And being come thither, and knocking
at the Door, <hi>George Penderill,</hi> the
youngeſt Brother of five, who were all
ſeverally inſtrumental in Conducting
and Preſerving his Majeſty; hearing
ſome body knock at the Gate ſo early,
opened the Window, and ſeeing there
Mr. <hi>Gifford</hi> and <hi>Francis Yates,</hi> who was
his Brother-in-law, he ask'd his Brother
what news he brought from <hi>Worceſter,</hi>
he replied, the King was defeated, and
the Enemy in purſuit of him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bid him make haſte and let them
in: But before he could get down, the
King, with moſt of the Lords, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the Houſe, and got into the Hall,
whither the King's Horſe was likewiſe
brought. And having that night rode
from <hi>Worceſter</hi> thither, which was about
twenty ſix Miles, he was extream
hungry, and very much tired with his
long and haſty March: whereupon
<hi>Gifford</hi> preſently ſent for <hi>Richard Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derill,</hi>
who lived near hand, at <hi>Hobbal-Grange,</hi>
and <hi>William Penderill</hi> from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57792:88"/>
                  <hi>Boſcobel. Richard</hi> came firſt, who was
immediately ſent back to bring a ſute
of his Cloaths for the King; and by
that time he came with them, <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>
was come likewiſe, and both car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in to the King by the Earl of <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi>
who told <hi>William,</hi> that was the
King, pointing to him, and that he
muſt have a care of him, and preſerve
him as he had done him; <hi>Gifford</hi> laying
the ſame charge on his Brother, which
was exactly obeyed by both.</p>
               <p>The King was adviſed, whil'ſt the
two Brothers were ſent for, to rub his
Hands and Face with the Soot of the
Chimney, the better to diſguiſe him;
and ſome perſons likewiſe diſorderly
cut off his locks of hair: and having
taken off his blue Ribbond, Buff-Coat,
and other Princely Ornaments, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed
what Gold he had in his
Pockets amongſt his Servants, put on
a courſe Canvas Shirt, (which was
borrowed of one <hi>Martyn,)</hi> which done
he was to take upon him the Name
and Employment of a Woodman;
and having, after the Company was
diſmiſs'd, a Bill brought him, he and
<hi>Richard</hi> went out into the Wood:
<hi>William</hi> went home, and <hi>Humphry</hi> and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57792:88"/>
                  <hi>George</hi> went out to ſcout, the better to
diſcover if any of the Parliament
Forces approach'd that way: And it
was not above an hour, that the King
had been in the Wood, before a Troop
of the Enemies Horſe came to <hi>White-ladies,</hi>
inquiring for the King. But
being told by the Towns-folks, that
there was, about three hours before, a
party of Horſe come thither, and, as
they imagin'd, the King with them,
but had made no ſtay; whereupon,
inquiring which way they went, they
were ſo eager upon the purſuit, that
they made no farther ſearch. The
King had notice of this, by the two
Brothers, who were often ſtraggling
into the Town for Intelligence: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ſtaid all that day in the Wood,
ſometimes lying on the Ground, and
ſometimes walking, it being ſo rainy,
that the thickeſt Tree therein was not
able to keep him dry; and being about
Noon very hungry, <hi>Richard</hi> ordered
his Siſter, the Wife of the aforeſaid
<hi>Yates,</hi> to provide him ſomething to
eat, and bring it into the Wood,
which was done accordingly; which
was a Meſs of Milk, mix'd with Eggs
and Sugar, in a black earthen Diſh:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57792:89"/>
The King gueſſing it to be Milk and
Apples, and ſaying, that he loved it
very well.</p>
               <p>In the Evening he left the Wood,
and went with <hi>Richard, Humphry,</hi> and
<hi>George,</hi> and <hi>Yates,</hi> to <hi>Richard</hi>'s Houſe,
under the Name of <hi>William Jones,</hi> a
Wood-cutter, newly come thither for
work; being forced to content himſelf
with a Supper of Bacon and Eggs, of
which, after he had eaten a little, he
ask'd <hi>Richard,</hi> if he would not eat?
who replying, <hi>Yes, Sir:</hi> he ſaid, then
you have a better ſtomach than I; for
you have eaten five times to day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
Being reſolved to depart that
Night to Mrs. <hi>Woolf</hi>'s Houſe, at <hi>Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
Jane Penderil,</hi> the Mother of the
five Brethren came to ſee him; bleſſing
God, that her Children were honoured
to be the Inſtruments, as ſhe hoped, of
his ſafe-guard and deliverance. At
his departure, they all took their leaves
of him, (except <hi>Richard,</hi> who was to
conduct him thither) beſeeching God
to guide and bleſs him; and <hi>Yates</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offered him Thirty Shillings, which
was all he had; whereof he took
Ten, and bid him put up the reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:57792:89"/>
As he went toward <hi>Madeley,</hi> he met
with an ill favour'd Encounter at <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>-Mill,
about two Miles from that
place: The Miller (as it afterward
appear'd, a Loyal Man, though they
knew it not) had then in his Houſe
ſome conſiderable perſons of the King's
Army, that had juſt then taken ſhelter
there, in their flight from <hi>Worceſter;</hi>
and being alarm'd, by <hi>Richard</hi>'s un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
permitting a Gate to clap,
through which they paſs'd, was upon
his watch, to ſpy if there was any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and boldly demanding, Who
was there? <hi>Richard</hi> fearing he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
them, quitted the uſual way, in ſome
haſt, and waded through a little Brook,
the King thereupon doing the like, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
him only by the ratling of his
Leather Breeches, whereby they eſcap'd
the Innocent Miller, who not knowing
but that they were Enemies, was as
glad that he was rid of them.</p>
               <p>When they came to <hi>Madeley,</hi> they
found Mr.. <hi>Woolf</hi>'s Family all in bed;
but <hi>Richard</hi> having knock'd them up,
and acquainted Mr. <hi>Woolf</hi>'s Daughter,
who came firſt to the door, that the
King was there, ſhe immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
them into the Houſe, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh'd
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57792:90"/>
himſelf for ſome time, but
underſtanding the Rebels kept ſeveral
Guards upon the <hi>Severn,</hi> and fearing
that ſome of their Party (becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them paſs'd frequently through
that Town) might Quarter at the houſe,
as he underſtood they had often done,
he thought it unſafe to lodge there,
ſince they had no ſecret place for his
concealment, but rather choſe to retire
into a Barn near adjoining, as a place
leſs liable to the danger of a ſurpriſe,
where he continu'd all the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>During his ſtay in that Place, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
with Mr. <hi>Woolf,</hi> about his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Journey into <hi>Wales,</hi> who ſent
a truſty Servant of his, to learn more
particularly the ſtrength and number
of thoſe Guards upon the <hi>Severn;</hi>
who brought them word, that not only
all the Bridges were ſecur'd, but the
Paſſage-Boats likewiſe ſeiz'd on; ſo
that it would not be ſafe for him to
proſecute his deſigned Journey into
<hi>Wales:</hi> So that <hi>Woolf</hi> adviſed him
rather to repair to <hi>Boſcobel-houſe,</hi> which
he aſſur'd him was the moſt retir'd
place, and the fitteſt for his conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in all thoſe parts, and there ſtay
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57792:90"/>
till an opportunity of a ſafer convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
could be found out. According
to which advice he reſolved to repair
thither the night following; and in
the mean time, his Hands and Face not
appearing ſufficiently diſcoloured, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to his other diſguiſes, <hi>Woolf</hi>
provided Walnut-tree Leaves, as the
readieſt expedient for that purpoſe;
and having boiled them, bathed his
Hands and Face in the Water.</p>
               <p>Toward the Evening he adventured
to return again into the Houſe, and
having refreſh'd himſelf, and being
furniſh'd with conveniencies for his
Journey, which was conceived to be
ſafeſt on foot, he departed about Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the Night, with <hi>Richard,</hi> who
was his faithful Guide toward <hi>Boſcobel,</hi>
where they arrived about Three next
Morning: Being come near the Houſe,
<hi>Richard</hi> left him in the Wood, whil'ſt
he went in to ſee that there were no
Soldiers there, or any other appearance
of danger, where he found Col. <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,</hi>
who was one of the laſt that fled
from <hi>Worceſter;</hi> whereby it was not
without incredible difficulty that he
made his eſcape; and having conceal'd
himſelf in <hi>Boſcobel</hi>-Wood for ſome
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57792:91"/>
time, was juſt then come thither, to
get ſome relief of <hi>William Penderil,</hi>
his old acquaintance: And being told
by <hi>Richard,</hi> that the King was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
he preſently went with him,
where they found him ſitting on the
root of a Tree; but being extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
glad to ſee the Colonel ſafe, came
with him into the Houſe, where he fed
very heartily on courſe Bread and
Cheeſe, and a Poſſet, which, as a rarity,
was made for him by <hi>William</hi>'s Wife,
of thin Milk and ſmall Beer; And his
Feet being extream dirty, and very
much galled with travel, he was forced
to waſh them, and for want of Shoes
to wear, whil'ſt his own were dried,
they were forced to put ſome hot Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
into his own, to dry them a little,
whil'ſt his Feet were a waſhing.</p>
               <p>Being a little refreſh'd, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
by the Colonel, to go back into
the Wood, which he ſuppoſed was
ſafer than the Houſe, where the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
made choice of a thick-leaved Oak,
into which <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> help'd
them both up, and brought them ſuch
Proviſions as they could get, and a
Cuſhion for the King to ſit on, whom
the Colonel intreated, in regard that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57792:91"/>
he had taken little or no reſt the two
preceding nights, to ſeat himſelf
as eaſily as he could, and then reſt
his Royal head in his Lap, aſſuring him,
that he would be ſo watchful, that he
need not fear the danger of falling;
which he willingly accepted of, and
ſlumbred away ſome part of that day,
bearing all theſe harſhips and afflictions
with a moſt incomparable patience. In
the evening he returned to the Houſe,
and was Conducted, by <hi>William,</hi> to
the ſame place wherein <hi>Darby</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been ſecured, which he liked ſo
well, that he reſolved, during his ſtay
there, to truſt only to it, and go no
more into the Royal Oak, as it was
thenceforward called, where he could
not ſo much as ſit at eaſe. And now,
ſuppoſing himſelf poſſeſt of a hopeful
ſecurity, he deſired <hi>William</hi> to ſhave
him, and cut the hair of his head, as
ſhort on the top of his crown as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers
would do it, only leaving ſome
about the ears, according to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
mode; <hi>Carleſs,</hi> who ſtood by, told
him, <hi>William</hi> was but a mean Barber:
to which he replied, he was no compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Judg of that, in regard he was
never ſhaved before. He bad <hi>William</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:57792:92"/>
burn the hair, which was the only Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
he was diſobedient to, during
his whole attendance upon the King:
for he reſerved a good part of it, and
kept it as a civil Relick, with ſome
whereof he afterwards pleaſured ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
perſons of Quality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Humphry Penderil</hi> being, on the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi>
following, at <hi>Shefnil,</hi> whither he
went to pay ſome Taxes, to one Captain
<hi>Broadeway;</hi> at whoſe Houſe he met
with a certain Colonel of the Rebels,
who was then newly come from <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>
in purſuit of the King: and being
informed that he had been at <hi>White-Ladies,</hi>
and that <hi>Humphry</hi> was a near
Neighbour to the place, and had ſome
Relations lived in the Houſe, he examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him ſtrictly, laying before him the
penalty of concealing him, which was
death without mercy, and the reward
promiſed for the diſcovering of him,
which was 1000 l. certain pay. But
ſo fixt was his Loyalty, that neither fear
of Puniſhment, nor hope of Reward,
was able to tempt him to a breach of
that truſt which the King had placed in
him and his Relations; but he pleaded
ignorance, and ſo was diſmiſs'd: And
at night acquainted the King with the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57792:92"/>
whole paſſage; at the relating where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and conſidering the price ſet upon
his head, he look'd ſomewhat diſmay'd,
as having truſted his Life in the hands
of ſuch poor men, who might perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
for ſuch a Sum as that, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
from their fidelity; which <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry</hi>
perceiving, was extreamly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with his raſhneſs, in acquainting
the King ſo unadviſedly therewith:
But <hi>Carleſs</hi> aſſuring him, that altho'
it was 100000 <hi>l.</hi> yet he would engage
his Soul for their honeſty; and <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry</hi>
backing it with ſeveral ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations,
he was pretty well ſatisfied.
That night <hi>Richard</hi>'s Wife, whom he
was pleaſed to call his Dame <hi>Joan,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
ſome Chickens for his Supper,
(a Dainty he had not lately been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with) and a little Bed put
into the ſecret place for him to lye on,
ſome of the Brothers being by turns
continually upon duty, watching the
ſeveral Avenues of the Houſe, and the
Road-way, thereby to prevent the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of a ſurpriſe.</p>
               <p>After Supper, the Colonel ask'd him,
What Meat he would pleaſe to have
provided for the Morrow, being Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day?
He told him, That he could wiſh
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57792:93"/>
they had ſome Mutton, if it might be
had; which was ſomewhat difficult,
in regard it was thought dangerous
for <hi>William</hi> to go to any Market to
buy it, ſince his Neighbours all knew
he uſed not to buy any ſuch Meat for
his own Diet, and ſo it might have
begot a ſuſpicion in them, of his having
ſtrangers in his Houſe; But the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
willing to ſatisfie his Sovereign's
deſire, early, on Sunday-Morning, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd
to Mr. <hi>William Stanton</hi>'s Sheep-Coat,
who ren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed ſome of <hi>Boſcobel</hi>-Ground,
and having choſen out one
of the beſt Sheep, ſtruck him with his
Dagger, and ordered <hi>William</hi> to carry
him home.</p>
               <p>His Dormitory being none of the
beſt, nor his Bed the eaſieſt, he got up
pretty early on Sunday-Morning, and
having, near the ſecret place where he
lay, the conveniency of a Gallery to
walk in, he was obſerved to ſpend ſome
time in his Devotions; and after his
coming down into the Parlour, his
Noſe fell a bleeding, which put them
all into a great fright, till they were
pacified by his telling them, it often
did ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:57792:93"/>
As ſoon as the Mutton was well
cold, <hi>William</hi> cut it up, and bringing
a Legg of it into the Parlour, the King
call'd for a Knife and a Trencher, and
having cut ſome of it into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ollops, and
prick'd them with a Knive's point,
call'd for a Frying Pan, and very artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
cook'd them himſelf, of which,
when they were ready, he eat very
heartily; the Colonel in the mean time
officiating as the Under-Cook, (which
he look'd upon as a great Honour too,)
making the Fire, and turning the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops
in the Pan: Which Paſſage being,
after their ſafe arrival in <hi>France,</hi> call'd
to mind, and merrily reflected upon,
he propoſed it as a Problemetical Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
Whether Himſelf, or the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
were the Maſter-Cook at <hi>Boſcobel?</hi>
And the ſupremacy was judg'd of right
to belong to him. The other Brothers
were, in the mean time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> applied in their
ſeveral ſtations, either ſcouting abroad,
to learn Intelligence, or upon ſome
other neceſſary Service; But it ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
God, that, although the Soldiers
had ſome Intelligence of his Majeſty's
having been at <hi>White-ladies,</hi> and knew
that he was gone thence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they
never ſearch'd the Houſe, nor that of
<hi>Boſcobel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:57792:94"/>
He ſpent ſome part of that Lord's
day in reading in a pleaſant Arbour, he
met withal in <hi>Boſcobel</hi>-Garden, planted
upon a Mount, wherein there was a
ſtone Table, and Seats about it, which
he very much commended for its reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſs:
And having underſtood by
<hi>John Penderil,</hi> that the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi>
was at Mr. <hi>Whitgrave</hi>'s Houſe, he ſent
him thither, to let him know, he was
well, and would come himſelf to
<hi>Moſely</hi> that night: But when <hi>John</hi>
came to <hi>Moſely,</hi> he was removed from
thence to <hi>Bently;</hi> at which he was very
much troubled: but, however, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>Whitgrave,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Huddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi>
who was then there, that the
King was returned to <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> and with
the ill accommodation he had there;
whereupon they both reſolved to go
with him to <hi>Bently,</hi> where the Lord
<hi>Wilmot</hi> appointed to meet them and
the King, in a little Grove of Trees,
not far from <hi>Whitgrave</hi>'s Houſe, about
Twelve or One of the Clock that
Night; and ordered <hi>John</hi> to return
again to <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> and acquaint the
King therewith: who having not yet
recovered his late foot Journey to
<hi>Madeley,</hi> was not able, without a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57792:94"/>
Horſe, to Travel to <hi>Moſely;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was concluded, that he ſhould
ride upon <hi>Humphry</hi>'s Mill-horſe, (he
being the Miller of <hi>White-ladies</hi> Mill)
which was taken up from graſs, and
not accoutred with rich Trappings, or
ſuch gaudy Furniture as would have
becom'd ſo great a King, but with
a ſorry old Saddle, and a worſe
Bridle.</p>
               <p>When he was ready to mount, <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi>
being ſo well known in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
that his attendance would in all
probability have proved rather a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice
than any advantage to him, he
humbly took his leave of him, heartily
praying for his conſtant preſervation;
with which excuſe he was ſo well
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eas'd, that he afterward gave him,
by Letters Patent under the Great Seal
of <hi>England,</hi> by the Name of <hi>William
Carlos,</hi> which in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſignifies,
<hi>Charles,</hi> an honourable Coat of Arms,
bearing an Oak proper, in a Field Or;
a Feſs-Gules, charged with Three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal

                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:57792:95"/>
Having parted with the Colonel, he
rode toward <hi>Moſely,</hi> being led thither
through By-ways, altho' it was Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
by the five Brothers, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
at a convenient diſtance, each
of them having a Pike-ſtaff, or a Bill,
on their ſhoulders, and ſome of them
Piſtols in their Pockets; reſolving, if
they ſhould have been queſtioned, or
encountred, by five or ſix Troopers only,
to have ſhewed their Valour, in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, as well as their Fidelity, in
concealing of him: He had not rid far,
before he began to complain of the
Horſe, being never uſed to ride ſuch
kind of Beaſts as that was, That it
was the heavieſt, dull Jade, that he ever
rode on: whereupon the owner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
ſomewhat beyond the uſual no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Miller, <hi>My Liege, can you

Kingdoms on his back?</hi> When they
were come to <hi>Penford</hi>-Mill, which was
within two Miles of <hi>Whitgrave</hi>'s Houſe,
his Guides deſired him to alight, and
walk the reſt of the way, the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>path
being more ſecure and much nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
which he conſented too; and <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry</hi>
and <hi>George</hi> being to return with
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57792:95"/>
the Horſe; the reſt waited on him, to
his Journey's end, but having forgot,
upon parting, to take his leave of thoſe
that went back, he haſtily turned, and
called them to him again, and ſaid, <hi>My
Troubles make me forget my ſelf; I thank
you all:</hi> And ſo having given them his
Hand to kiſs, he proceeded on his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wilmot,</hi> according to his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
came to the meeting-place,
at his hour, and was received by <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi>
and conveyed to his old Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but was extreamly troubled, when
he found the King was not there at his
prefixed time; which made him ſuſpect
the worſt, and fear that ſome misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had befallen him; wherefore he
deſired <hi>Whitgrave</hi> to repair again to
the place of meeting, where they had
left <hi>Huddleſton</hi> to attend the King's
coming; who appearing there about
two hours after his appointed time was
expired, they conducted him to the
Houſe, where that diſconſolate Lord
had long expected him with great ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude:
ſo ſoon as he ſaw him enter, he
kneeled down, and embraced his Knees;
and in requital, the King kiſs'd him on
the Cheek, and demanded ſomewhat
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57792:96"/>
earneſtly of him, what was become of
<hi>Buckingham, Cleveland,</hi> and others?
to which he anſwered, that he could
give him no account, but hoped in
general, that they were ſafe. Then the
Lord addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Whitgrave</hi>
and <hi>Huddleſton,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Tho' I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
concealed the Name of my Friend,
yet now I adventure to tell you, That it is
my Maſter, your Maſter, and the Maſter
of us all:</hi> Whereupon the King gave
them his Hand to kiſs, and told them,
that he had received ſuch an account,
from <hi>Wilmot,</hi> of their Fidelity, that he
ſhould never forget it, deſiring to ſee
the ſecret place where he was to be
concealed; which having viewed, he
liked it very well. And then returning
into <hi>Wilmot</hi>'s Chamber, he ſate down
on the Beds ſide, and his Noſe bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he pluck'd out of his Pocket a
Handkerchief courſe and dirty, being
ſuitable to the reſt of his Apparel,
which was a Leather Doublet, a pair
of green Breeches, and a Jump-Coat,
(as the Country call'd it) of the ſame
green, a pair of his own Stockings,
with the tops cut off, becauſe they were
embroidered, a pair of old Shooes, cut
and ſlaſh'd, to give eaſe to his Feet, an
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57792:96"/>
old, gray, greaſie Hat, without a
lining, and a noggen Shirt, of the
courſeſt Linnen; his Face and Hands
likewiſe being anſwerable thereunto,
made of a ruſty complexion, by the
help of the Walnut-leaves. <hi>Huddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>
obſerving the courſeneſs of his
Shirt was very troubleſom to him, and
hindred his reſt, deſired know, if he
would change it? which he being
willing to do, he furniſh'd him with a
flaxen one; and pulling off his Shooes
and Stockings, carefully dried his
Feet, where he found that ſome-body
had innocently put white Paper next
his Feet, which, with going on foot
from the place where he alight, to the
houſe, was ſo roul'd between his Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and his Skin, that it ſerved rather
to increaſe than aſſwage their former
ſoreneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whitgrave</hi> had by this time brought
up ſome Bisket, and a Bottle of Sack,
whereof the King having eat of the
one, and drank of the other, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf a little refreſh'd, ſaid mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
<hi>I am now ready for another march;
and if it ſhould pleaſe God once more, to
place me in the head of but Eight or Ten
Thouſand Men, of one mind, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57792:97"/>
to fight, I ſhould not doubt my being
able to drive thoſe Rogues out of my
Kingdoms.</hi> It being now toward break
of day, he was deſirous to take a little
ſleep, in order whereunto a Pallate
was carried into one of the ſecret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
where he lay down and compos'd
himſelf to reſt, but ſlept not ſo well as
his Hoſt wiſh'd he might, in regard
the place was close and inconvenient;
after he had lain ſome time in his hole,
he got up, and was pleas'd to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, and very familiarly ſalute,
Mrs. <hi>Whitgrave,</hi> Mother to him who
was the owner of the houſe; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his place of retreat ſtill ready, he
diverted himſelf now and then in a
Cloſet over the Porch, from whence he
could ſee thoſe who paſs'd by on the
Road.</p>
               <p>Not thinking it convenient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
long there, he diſpatch'd <hi>John
Penderil</hi> to Col. <hi>Lane</hi> at <hi>Bently,</hi> with
directions for him to ſend, or bring, the
Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi>'s Horſes that night, about
Twelve or One of the Clock, to a Field
near adjoining to <hi>Whitgrave</hi>'s Houſe,
in order to his putting in execution a
Reſolution he had taken up, of going
<hi>Weſtward,</hi> under the protection of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57792:97"/>
Mrs. <hi>Jane Lane</hi>'s Paſs, which ſhe had
procured for her ſelf and her man, to
<hi>Briſtol,</hi> it being moſt probable that the
Rebels would purſue him only <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
and not at all ſuſpect his going
into the <hi>West.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Afternoon, on Munday, <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi>
having notice, that ſome Soldiers
were in the neighbourhood, intending
to apprehend him, upon information
that he had been at <hi>Worceſter</hi>-Fight;
he firſt ſecured the King, who was then
lain down upon <hi>Huddleſton</hi>'s Bed, into
his place of retreat; and then, leaving
open all the Chamber-doors, he went
boldly down to the Soldiers, aſſuring
them that he had not been from home
in a Fortnight before, with which Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveration,
and the Teſtimony of his
Neighbours, the Soldiers were ſo well
ſatisfied, that they departed without
going up the ſtairs at all. The old
Gentlewoman being told that After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
by a Country-man, who came to
her houſe, that he heard the King had,
upon his retreat, beaten his Enemies
at <hi>Warrington</hi> Bridge, and that there
were three Kings come in to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance:
As ſoon as he was gon, ſhe
went up, and related the ſtory to his
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57792:98"/>
Majeſty for his divertiſement; who ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
anſwered, ſurely they were the
three Kings of <hi>Cullen</hi> come down from
Heaven, for he could not imagine what
other Kings they ſhould be; at which
time, looking out at the Cloſet Window,
he ſaw two Soldiers paſſing by on the
Road, telling <hi>Huddleſton</hi> that he knew
one of them to be a <hi>Highlander,</hi> and of
his own Regiment, who little imagined
his King and Colonel to be ſo near: and
thereupon entred into ſome diſcourſe
with him, about the particulars of the
Battel at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who told him,
that his Counſels had been ſooner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to the Rebels than executed by
his Loyal Subjects.</p>
               <p>On <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> about one in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Lane</hi> himſelf brought the Horſes to
conduct him to <hi>Wilmot,</hi> who went the
day before to <hi>Lanes</hi> Houſe at <hi>Bently.</hi> At
his departure from <hi>Whitgrave</hi>'s, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
his gratuity by returning
them many thanks, giving them dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to repair to a Merchant in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
who ſhould have order to furniſh
them with Mony and means to convey
them beyond the Sea, if their entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him ſhould happen to be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
promiſing moreover, that if
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57792:98"/>
ever God ſhould reſtore him to his
Crown, he would not be unmindful of
their civilities. And ſo being furniſh'd
with a Cloak and Boots, he went to a
corner of the Orchard where <hi>Lane</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
him, and went with him to
<hi>Bently,</hi> where, according to his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he took the opportunity of her Paſs,
and rode before her to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> the Lord
Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> attending him at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
The King being ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed
in body, complained to Miſtris
<hi>Lane</hi> that his Cloak wearied him;
whereupon ſhe deſired her Father, who
likewiſe rode with them, to carry it for
him: but ſhe had not rode far, before
ſhe met her Brother-in-law, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
if her Father muſt carry her
man's Cloak; ſhe replied, to wipe off
all ſuſpicion, that it was ſo big, that it
often endangered the throwing her
down, or otherwiſe ſhe would not have
been ſo uncivil. And no ſooner was
they rid of this danger, but they met
with one far greater; for being to paſs
through a Town, where a Troop of
Horſe was drawn up, as if on purpoſe
to oppoſe their paſſage, he began to fear
the worſt; but the Captain was very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
and taking them for honeſt Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57792:99"/>
(as indeed they were,) comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his Troop to open to the Right and
Left and give them free and quiet paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
               <p>To intermix ſo many Tragical ſtories
with a little mirth, I cannot paſs by an
accident which happened to him at
<hi>Leigh,</hi> which, although ſurrounded with
ſo many misfortunes, made him laugh
at the conceit of it. For being left there
in the Kitchin, under the notion of a
Serving-man, the Maid entred into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe
with him, inquiring where he
was born, what trade he was, how long
he had lived with Miſtris <hi>Lane,</hi> and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſuch Queſtion, ſuitable to a Kitchin
Maids curioſity; to which he replied,
he was born at <hi>Brumingham</hi> and was a
N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ylors Son. But the Jack being down,
ſhe deſired him to wind it up; which
task he willingly undertook, but being
unskilful therein, went the wrong way
about it, and was like to have ſpoiled
the Jack: whereupon the Maid highly
incenſed, (it being uſual with Cooks
to be of cholerick diſpoſitions,) ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her paſſion in <hi>Billingſgate</hi> terms,
asking him, Where he was bred? and
telling him, he was the moſt ignorant
fellow ſhe ever ſaw in her life, that
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57792:99"/>
could not tell how to wind up a Jack,
with other ſuch kind of Language as
came uppermoſt, which being uttered
with much vehemence, made him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his preſent condition,
walk out of the Room ſmiling.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman having great reſort
to his Houſe, he feared it might occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a diſcovery of his Perſon; he ſeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf ſick of an <hi>Ague,</hi> and under
that pretence, kept his Chamber all
day, and came down only at nights:
and that his Diſeaſe might appear real,
he deſired of the Butler a Glaſs of
Wine, who courteouſly invited him
into the Cellar, and there forced him
to drink two or three Healths, one to his
Majeſty, and another to his Mother.
But at length, by ſomething he obſerved
in him, notwithſtanding his Diſguiſe,
he ſuſpected him to be the King; and
thereupon falling on his knees, begged
his Pardon, and aſſured him he would
be faithful to him in whatſoever he
ſhould command him: of which he
took little or no notice, but having
drunk off his Wine went away. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Butler's ſuſpicion increaſing,
he went up and inquired of M. <hi>Laſſel,</hi>
who though angry at the Butler's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitiveneſs,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57792:100"/>
yet he demanded the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of it; and the Butler, whiſpering
him in the ear, told him, he believed it
was the King: upon which unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
accident, he ſent for him up, and
acquainted him with the Butlers ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
who though he was diſpleaſed
with his not having acquainted him
firſt with it, yet putting confidence in
him, denied it not, and afterward
found him very inſtrumental in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
through the Country.</p>
               <p>Being deſirous to free himſelf from
all dangers of diſcovery, he was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to haſten his putting out to Sea;
but though there lay a little Bark there,
deemed very fit for that purpoſe, yet
the Maſter would for no reward be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon to tranſport a ſingle Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
whereupon, unwilling to tempt
Providence too far, he reſolved to go
farther <hi>Weſt,</hi> to a Noble Gentlemans
Houſe whom he knew to be a truſty
friend, being accompanied thither by
Mr. <hi>Laſſell</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Lane,</hi> where he was
concealed for about a week, and at laſt
preparation was made for his paſſage.
But coming to the place where it was
provided, he chanced to dine with a
Colonel of the Parliament Army;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57792:100"/>
whereupon, fearing that his embarking
ſingly might raiſe ſome ſuſpicion in
him, he rather choſe to loſe the benefit
of his paſſage, than after ſo many
Storms and Tempeſts to ſplit upon a
Rock within ſight of Harbour, and
therefore returned to the place from
whence he came: from whence, after
about three weeks longer concealment,
he was conveyed through by-ways to a
Gentlemans Houſe in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
continued ſome few days, and the
heat of the ſearch after him being now
pretty well over, he was at laſt furniſh'd
with a ſmall Veſſel which took him in
at <hi>Sharrem,</hi> a little Creek in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Landed him near <hi>Havre-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace</hi>
in <hi>Normandy.</hi> When the Skipper
ſaw him he was a little daunted, for he
preſently knew him, having ſeen him
divers times before; but having ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
collected himſelf, he ſaid, ſince he
had undertaken ſo good a work, he was
reſolved to venture hanging rather than
not perform it: to which the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
he need not put himſelf upon that
hazard, for, if he pleaſed, he ſhould go
along with him, where he ſhould not
want as long as he was able to provide
for him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:57792:101"/>
                  <hi>Hamilton, Darby, Lauderdale, Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
and the reſt, having thus diſpoſed
of the King in a way of ſecurity, march'd
from <hi>White-Ladies</hi> Northward, by the
way of <hi>Newport,</hi> in hope to overtake or
meet General <hi>Leſley</hi> with the main Body
of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Horſe; but aſſoon as they
were got into the Road, the Lord <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi>
who commanded his Majeſties
Life-Guard, overtook them, being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
by a Party of Rebels: whereupon
the Lords, with their followers, faced
about and repelled them. But when they
were got a little beyond <hi>Newport,</hi> ſome of
<hi>Lilburn</hi>'s Regiment meeting them in the
Front, and other Rebels from <hi>Worceſter</hi>
purſuing them in the Rear, themſelves
and Horſes being very much beaten out
and tired, <hi>Darby, Lauderdale, Gifford</hi>
and ſome others, were taken and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Priſoners firſt to <hi>Whit-Church,</hi> and
then to an Inn in <hi>Banbury,</hi> from whence
<hi>Gifford</hi> found means to eſcape. But <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>
was conveyed to <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> and
there tryed by a pretended Court Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal,
held by a Commiſſion from <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
grounded on an execrable <hi>Rump</hi>
Act, which traiterouſly pretended to
prohibit all correſpondence with <hi>Charles
Stuart,</hi> under penalty of High-Treaſon,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57792:101"/>
loſs of Life and Eſtate; by which he
was condemned to loſe his Life, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
his juſt Plea, that he had
Quarter granted him by Captain <hi>Edge,</hi>
who took him Priſoner: and was ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after Executed at <hi>Bolton</hi> in <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
in a moſt Barbarous and unhuman
manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lauderdale</hi> and others were conveyed
firſt to the Tower, and afterward to
<hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle, where they continued
divers years.</p>
               <p>But whilſt the Rebels were plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe Noble Perſons whom they had
taken Priſoners, the Duke, with <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,
Blague, Darcey May</hi> and others, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook
the Road, and betaking themſelves
to a by-way, got into <hi>Ceſſardine</hi> Woods,
not far from <hi>Newport,</hi> where they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſome refreſhment at a little obſcure
Houſe; and afterward by two honeſt
Labourers, whom they met withal in
an adjoyning Wood, and to whom they
communicated the miſery and diſtreſs
which the fortune of War had reduced
them to, were directed to places of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The Duke, in imitation of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Maſter, quitting his Horſe, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
his <hi>George,</hi> which was given him
by the Queen Mother, to Mr. <hi>May,</hi> who
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57792:102"/>
having preſerved it in ſeveral eminent
dangers, reſtored it to him again in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and changing habit with one of
the Workmen, he was, in that diſguiſe,
conveyed to the Houſe of one Mr. <hi>Haley,</hi>
at <hi>Biſtrop</hi> in <hi>Nottinghamſhire: Leviſton</hi>
and the reſt, all quitted their Horſes
likewiſe, and ſeverally ſhifted for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>The King being ſafely Landed in
<hi>Normandy,</hi> he went forthwith to <hi>Diepe,</hi>
where he provided himſelf with ſuch
neceſſaries as might ſerve him until he
came to his Mother in the <hi>French</hi> Court;
who, ſo ſoon as they heard of his ſafe
arrival, ſent ſeveral Perſons of Quality
to meet him with great Pomp, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
his Perſon, who received him
with much gladneſs, and very much
rejoyced at his ſafety, conveying him
to <hi>Paris</hi> in the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> his own
Coach; where he found ſuch a welcom
as his Perſon and Worth deſerved, and
as great as that Court could expreſs
for the ſafety of their beſt Allie: and
by his Mother and the two Dukes, with
as great a joy as became them upon the
receiving of him whom they once
thought had been loſt and periſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:57792:102"/>
Theſe Complements being once over,
he purſued his intereſt in <hi>Holland,</hi> by
the mediation of his Siſter the Princeſs
of <hi>Orange,</hi> and his Aunt the Queen of
<hi>Bohemia,</hi> indeavouring to prevail with
them, according to their former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
to undertake a War againſt the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament, which they accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
did: but being not able to cope
with the Valour of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nor
prevail againſt that ſucceſs which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be entailed to the <hi>Rump</hi> in all
their undertakings, they were unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
therein, and it contributed very
little toward the promoting of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
               <p>The King being once again excluded
out of all his Dominions, they quickly
after reduced <hi>Corn-Caſtle</hi> in the Iſle of
<hi>Guernſey,</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Man,</hi> and all other
places both in <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> which ſtood out for him.</p>
               <p>Which was no ſooner done, but
there happened a ſtrange alteration in
the Scene of affairs in <hi>England;</hi> for
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> whoſe ambition was now ripe,
knowing that he could not expect a
fairer opportunity to Uſurp that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Power which he had ſo long
been aſpiring too, in regard every one
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57792:103"/>
began now to grow weary of the baſe
actions of the <hi>Rump,</hi> whoſe dilatory
proceedings, and apparent intentions
of perpetuating themſelves, rendred
them hateful to all Mankind: he entred
into their Houſe, attended by ſome of
his principal Officers, where having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
divers reaſons why, he thought,
that Parliament ought to be Diſſolved,
and a period put to its ſitting: He
commanded them, (notwithſtanding
they were his Maſters, and from whom
he derived his Commiſſion,) immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to depart, which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly;
for how unwilling ſoever they
were to obey, yet it was now out of
their Power to diſpute his Authority:
ſo that thoſe who had murthered one
King, and refuſed to reſtore a ſecond,
were turned out of door, and deprived
of all Authority and Power, by their
own Servant. Whereat the whole
Nation rejoyced, and ſcarce a Man
grieved for their Diſſolution but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
every one believing, that though
the Nation might not peradventure be
bettered by that change, yet it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
impoſſible it ſhould be worſe: but
however, <hi>Cromwel</hi> fearing that ſome
might be diſcontented with his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57792:103"/>
Publiſhed a large and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Declaration, ſhewing his Reaſons
for his Diſſolving of them.</p>
               <p>But his deſign being only to make
himſelf great, he did not intend to
give relief, by taking away the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
but by changing of it only; and
therefore inſtead of that <hi>Juncto</hi> which
he pulled down, ſet up another of his
own arbitrary election, who knowing
before-hand what they had to do, after
having ſate a while, reſigned up their
power to him, who reſolving to make
the beſt of that reſignation, pretended
that the whole Supream Power and
Authority of the three Kingdoms, both
Civil and Military, was thereby in
courſe devolved upon him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
calling a Councel of Officers, to
conſult about ſetling the Government;
they reſolved, after ſeveral debates, to
have a Common-wealth in a ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and that perſon ſhould be <hi>Oliver
Cromwel,</hi> by the name and ſtyle of <hi>Lord
Protector,</hi> &amp;c. He at firſt ſeemingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
the Dignity, altho' it was the
only thing he aimed at; but being preſs'd
by the Officers of the Army, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to accept of it, and was inſtall'd
with great pomp in the Chancery-Court
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57792:104"/>
at <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> and ſhortly
after concluded a Peace with the
<hi>Dutch:</hi> He was afterward importuned
by his Parliament, to exchange his Title
of <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> for that of <hi>King;</hi>
which he refuſed, and choſe rather to
continue the old.</p>
               <p>The King, when he came into <hi>France,</hi>
found that Court very much embroil'd,
on the account of ſome miſ-underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
between the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and
other Princes of the Blood, and the
Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to compoſe, urging his own dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the King, and adviſing him to
beware how he provok'd his Subjects;
and urging the King's power to the
Princes of the Blood, whereby he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
drew upon himſelf the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
of both parties; being ſuſpected by
the Cardinal, to be for the Princes;
and by them, to take part with him,
againſt their intereſt; which they were
the more induced to believe, becauſe
he withdrew the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Forces from
their Service, and imployed them to
reduce <hi>Ireland;</hi> knowing, that the
winning that was the moſt probable
way for the obtaining of <hi>England;</hi>
and promiſing, in recompence, to make
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57792:104"/>
that Duke, Duke of <hi>Ireland;</hi> but they
thought he only aimed at their diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment:
upon the account of which
miſinterpretations of his peaceable
deſign, in his endeavours to reconcile
them, he was forced to retire, for ſome
time, to St. <hi>Germans,</hi> his Mother being
ſcarce able to ſtay at the <hi>Louvre,</hi> for
the unreaſonable and cauſleſs clamours
of the miſtaken multitude; but when
their heat and fury was over, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thither again, where he ſtaid for
ſome time longer in great eſteem with
that Court, until the ſubtle Cardinal
began under-hand to make a Peace
with <hi>Cromwel;</hi> and when he could not,
by all the means he uſed, prevent its
taking effect, he retired toward <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
knowing that the iſſue of it
would be a fair complementing of him
out of their Dominions, and baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of him out of his very exile.</p>
               <p>Upon his arrival in <hi>Germany,</hi> he is
entertained by the Elector of <hi>Cologn;</hi>
and during his ſtay in that Court, he
had an interview with the Queen of
<hi>Sweden,</hi> whom, as the Report went,
he was to have married, had he not
diſliked her light and <hi>Frenchified</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment:
In the interview, he thank'd
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57792:105"/>
her for all thoſe civilities which ſhe
had for his ſake ſhewed to any of his
Friends, and particularly to <hi>Montroſs;</hi>
to which ſhe replied, their own and his
worth deſerved no leſs. There was
preſent at this interview, the King's
two Brothers, the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and
<hi>Gloceſter;</hi> the latter whereof was ſent
for by him from <hi>Paris,</hi> upon informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that his Mother had a deſign to
put him into the Jeſuits Colledge, and
breed him up in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion,
to which he was always an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
Enemy, and therefore would
not permit his Brother to be brought
up in it.</p>
               <p>And ſo pregnant an inſtance of his
intire love to, and reſolution to defend,
the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, profeſs'd in
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> was his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in this Affair, even in thoſe
days when there was ſo little hopes to
ſee it ever reſtored again, that I think
it worthy of a perpetual remembrance,
and therefore ſhall here inſert the chief
circumſtances relating to it.</p>
               <p>Having deſigned to take the Duke of
<hi>Gloceſter</hi> with him into <hi>Germany,</hi> he
was prevail'd upon, by the Queen, to
leave him with her at <hi>Paris,</hi> promiſing,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57792:105"/>
that ſhe would not permit any force to
be put upon him, for the prevailing
with him to change his Religion, but
that he ſhould be attended by thoſe
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Servants which himſelf had
placed about him, and have free liberty
to reſort to the Publick Service of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> at the King's Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
which was then at Sir <hi>Richard
Brown</hi>'s houſe, whom he left as his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
in <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But not long after his departure, the
Duke, under pretence of weaning him
from the company of ſome young
<hi>French</hi> Gallants, who being in the ſame
Academy, were grown into a more
familiar converſation with him than
was thought convenient, was removed
to Abbot <hi>Mountague</hi>'s houſe, at his Abby
near <hi>Pontoiſe,</hi> and after he had been
there a few days, Mr. <hi>Lovel,</hi> who was
his Tutor, going to <hi>Paris</hi> for one day
only upon buſineſs deſignedly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as was ſuſpected, by the Abbot;
during his abſence, he was vehemently
preſs'd, by the Abbot, with all the
ſtrongeſt Motives, Spiritual or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
that he thought might prevail
upon him, to turn <hi>Roman Catholick;</hi>
and having no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> near him at
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57792:106"/>
that time to adviſe withal, but
Mr. <hi>Griffin</hi> of his Bed-Chamber, a
Gentleman about his own age, both of
them not being able to make much
more than Thirty, he doubted not but
to prevail.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding the greenneſs
of his years, ſuch was his zeal for his
Religion, that after having made inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Replies to all the Abbots Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he told him, that he very much
admired how he durſt make that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
upon him, knowing that the
Queen had engaged her word to the
King, that no change of his Religion
ſhould be endeavoured; And telling
him, that for his own part he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
not to incurr the King's diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
by neglecting to obſerve his
Royal Command, whereby he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
forbid him to liſten to any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which ſhould be uſed with him
for the change of his Religion; And
that as to the ſpecious Pretences of
making him a Cardinal, or procuring
of him to be advanced to the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Throne, he did with indignation and
contempt, deride and reject them,
complaining withal of his being diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly
dealt with, by his being thus
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57792:106"/>
aſſaulted in the abſence of his Tutor,
whom the King had placed over him,
and who, he believed, could eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
the ſtrongeſt of his Arguments:
Which, upon his return, he did ſo fully,
that it was thought convenient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the Duke back again to <hi>Paris,</hi>
where he was permitted to reſort to the
King's Chappel, and enjoy the free
exerciſe of his Religion for the preſent,
though it was not long that he did ſo;
for after ſome little time, the Queen
own'd the attempt done on him, to be
with her own approbation, declaring,
that ſhe could not but endeavour (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
her Promiſe to the King,
that he ſhould not be forced) to have
her Son ſhewed the right way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and to have that way propoſed to
him, which ſhe thought moſt requiſite
for the guiding him thereunto: And
that ſhe might, notwithſtanding that
repulſe, prevail upon him by degrees,
his <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Tutor was put from him,
and himſelf hurried out of <hi>Paris</hi> in great
haſt, thereby to deprive him of the
aſſiſtance of any <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to Mr. <hi>Croft</hi>'s houſe, but under
the care of Abbot <hi>Mountague,</hi> none of
his Servants, but <hi>Griffin,</hi> being permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to attend him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:57792:107"/>
The News whereof did deeply affect
all the Loyal <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Exiles then in
<hi>Paris,</hi> but eſpecially the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi>
who underſtanding how violently that
young Prince was perſecuted for his
Religion, he conſulted with that famous
Confeſſor, for the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Couſins,</hi> then Dean of <hi>Peterborough</hi>
and Chaplain to his Majeſty, and ſince
the King's Reſtauration, Biſhop of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
who thereupon drew up what
Arguments and Inſtructions he thought
convenient, to fortifie the Duke in that
violent aſſault: And knowing how
ſtrictly he was guarded from the acceſs
of any <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> he being by his Lady
related to the Abbot, went to give
him a viſit; but his deſign was ſoon
gueſſed at, and tho' he obtain'd, for
that time, acceſs to the Duke, yet he
was ſo carefully watch'd, that it was
not without much difficulty, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived,
conveyed to him the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
that he had prepared for
him, and was forced, for the future,
to vary his ſtratagems, to procure far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Advices to be from time to time
delivered to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:57792:107"/>
And ſo narrowly was the Duke eyed,
by the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Spies ſet over him, and
the Prieſts, who were unceſſantly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
of him with their preſſures to
change his Religion, that he had no
opportunity to peruſe any of thoſe
Papers ſent him; ſo that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to deliver them to <hi>Griffin,</hi> who
in the Night, as he lay in his Bed-Chamber,
acquainted him what the
ſcope and tendency of them was; by
the advantage whereof, through the
aſſiſtance of almighty God, he did ſo
reſolutely withſtand all the violent
ſhocks of his Perſecutors, that they
thereupon reſolved not only to remove
<hi>Griffin,</hi> but to ſhut up the Duke in the
Jeſuits Colledge.</p>
               <p>The King being informed of all thoſe
Proceedings, immediately uſed all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
endeavours for his relief, and ſent
an expoſtulatory Letter to the Queen
his Mother, and laid his Commands
on all the moſt eminent of his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi>
Subjects there, to be to the
utmoſt of their power aiding and
aſſiſting to him in that great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs;
and ſending another Letter
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57792:108"/>
likewiſe to the Duke himſelf, which
was attempted ſome days before he
was removed to the Jeſuits Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to be delivered to him by
Sir <hi>George Ratcliff;</hi> but though he
was admitted to his preſence, yet
he could find no opportunity to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
him the Letter with privacy,
therefore left it with <hi>Griffin,</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to him.</p>
               <p>In which Letter he reminded him
of the ſtrict Command that he had
left with him at his departure, to
continue firm in his Religion; as
alſo the vanity of their Motives,
the emptineſs of their Promiſes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the laſt Charge of
their dead Father, which he ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gave him with the entail of his
Bleſſing annex'd thereunto; telling
him withal, that if he ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be perverted in his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
by any inticements whatſoever,
or put himſelf into the Jeſuits Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
he had then the laſt Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that ever he ſhould receive
from him, and muſt never look to
ſee his Face again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:57792:108"/>
As ſoon as the young Duke had,
with an unexpreſſible joy, received
this Letter, he firſt, with all poſſible
haſt, tranſcribed a Copy of it, and
and ſent it immediately to the Queen,
begging her leave to repair to <hi>Paris,</hi>
both upon the account of thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the King and the Duke of
<hi>York</hi>'s being then returned from the
<hi>French</hi> Army. But the Queen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to deſiſt from the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
what ſhe had began, ſent
him word, ſhe could not ceaſe
wiſhing his ſo great and eternal
good, as to change his Religion
would be, to which ſhe would not
force him; but yet adviſed him
however, to hearken to what the
Abbot ſhould farther deliver to him;
which was, that he ſhould at leaſt
be willing to go to the Jeſuits
Colledge, where he ſhould have
as much liberty in all things, as
himſelf could deſire. It being ſtill
their reſolution to have forced him
thither, if he refuſed, had it not
been prevented by the arrival of the
Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> whom the King
diſpatch'd thither from <hi>Germany,</hi> with
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57792:109"/>
Letters and Inſtructions, for the
reſcuing of him from his <hi>Popiſh</hi>
adverſaries; and had he ſtaid but
four days longer, before his arrival
at <hi>Paris,</hi> he had come too late, in
regard the Duke had certainly been
within that time ſhut up in the
Colledge, from whence there had
been no poſſibility of retrieving him;
For the <hi>French</hi> Court had ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
eſpouſed that Affair, that he
found himſelf neceſſitated to make
uſe of all the Prudence and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
he was Maſter of, before he
could accompliſh the buſineſs that
he came about: but finding that
it was not altogether too late, he
ſo effectually purſued thoſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
he received from the King,
that he procured the Duke's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>Paris,</hi> and liberty to enjoy
the free Exerciſe of his Religion:
But no ſooner did he come to the
<hi>French</hi> Court, to pay his reſpects to
the Queen, but the Queen-Mother of
<hi>France,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> preſs'd
him with all the Allurements imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
to turn <hi>Roman Catholick;</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him, that they look'd upon him
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57792:109"/>
as a Child of <hi>France,</hi> and that it was
for his advantage, and the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
they ſhould thereby have of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him the greater good, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
them to move him thereunto;
adding, that ſince his Father was
dead, he ought to obey his Mother's
Commands in all things. To which,
obſerving the King's Inſtructions, not
to engage in any Diſpute with them,
he replied only in general terms, That
he reſolved to obey his Mother as
much as any Son could, or ought to
do, and thereby diſſengaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from any farther purſuit at that
time.</p>
               <p>But all the allurements of the <hi>French</hi>
Court, and the utmoſt ſeverities uſed
toward him by his Mother, were not
able in the leaſt to ſhake his firmneſs
in his Religion; which the Queen
with great indignation perceiving,
ſome few days after took him apart:
and having, firſt, with all the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
imaginable, declared to him, how
great and tender thoſe affections ſhe
had for him were, and how much it
grieved her, that very love it ſelf ſhould
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57792:110"/>
compel her to proceed toward him
with ſome ſeeming ſeverity. She told
him that, for his eaſe ſake, ſhe would
ſhorten the time of his Tryal; and
therefore, propoſing to him, all the
good ſhe aimed at in that deſign, the
duty he owed her, and the diſability
of the King to maintain him, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him immediately to withdraw
into his Lodgings, and there give one
hearing more to Abbot <hi>Mountague,</hi> and
after, having ſequeſtred himſelf, for a
while, from all manner of diverſion,
to ponder ſeriouſly upon what ſhe and
he ſaid to him, and that night either
bring or ſend her a full and final an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Duke, taking the
advantage of the little interim of clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Room, ſent <hi>Griffin</hi> to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
of <hi>Ormond,</hi> deſiring him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to him immediately, that he
might adviſe with him, how he ought
to deport himſelf, as occaſion ſhould
ſerve, in that intended privacy with
his Mother and the Abbot. But <hi>Griffin</hi>
not preſently finding the Marqueſs, the
Abbot was there before him, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57792:110"/>
expaciated upon what the Queen
had but briefly hinted, he preſt the
Duke for his final anſwer, which he
refuſed to give, 'till he had firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
with the Marqueſs: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Abbot for the preſent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew,
deſiring to be ſent for ſo ſoon
as he was come, telling him, that if
it were not in an hours time, he
would return again, whether ſent for
or not. But it was not long after his
being withdrawn, that the Marqueſs
came; and the Duke having acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him with their Propoſals, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
his advice and directions
therein, was quickly reſolved what
anſwer to make, but having been ſo
long harraſſed, was deſirous to take a
little breath, and therefore neglected
to ſend preſently to the Abbot, and
went out of his Lodging, into the
Court, to divert himſelf: but no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was he gone than the Abbot came,
and miſſing him, ſought up and down
the Court for him, and having at laſt
found him, ſeverely rebuked him for
neglecting his Mothers command, and
his inſtructions, which was, ſeriouſly
to ponderate what he had ſaid, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:57792:111"/>
for neglecting to ſend for him according
to appointment.</p>
               <p>Well, Sir, ſaid the Duke, I have
ſeriouſly conſidered of all that hath
been ſaid to me, and my final anſwer
thereunto is, I am reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
firm in my Religion. Then, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Abbot, I am commanded, from
the Queen your Mother, to tell you,
that ſhe charges you to ſee her face no
more. At which diſmal expreſſion,
the Duke being not a little moved,
begged with great earneſtneſs, that
he might be permitted, at leaſt, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
her parting bleſſing, till he could
in time prevail for her pardon, but
could not obtain it, though he indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
it again the next morning,
(being <hi>Sunday,</hi> before ſhe went to her
Devotions,) by the interceſſion of his
Brother, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who did,
with great tenderneſs, compaſſionate
his condition, and with great earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
move on his behalf. But the
Queen proved inexorable, not only to
him, but to all others who ſpoke on
his behalf; nor would ſhe intimate
her pleaſure to him by any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57792:111"/>
than the Abbot, who ſolicited him
again, aggravating the peril of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
diſpleaſure: and adviſing him,
at that inſtant, being the moſt proper
time, as ſhe was going to Maſs at her
Monaſtery, to apply himſelf to her,
aſſuring him, that ſhe had thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals
to make to him, which would
ſet his heart at reſt, though, he ſaid,
he could not name them. To which
the Duke replied, if it were ſo, I could
apply my ſelf to her well enough, for
my heart can have no reſt, except in
the free exerciſe of my Religion, but I
fear her Propoſitions will not, I am
ſure yours never tended to give me any
eaſe or quiet; at which very inſtant,
the Queen paſſed by in her Coach to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
her Nunnery: whereupon the
Duke approached toward her, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to begg her Bleſſing, but was
with great indignation rejected. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
ſhewing himſelf very much diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
the Abbot came up to him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
what it was her Majeſty had
ſaid to him, that had put him into ſo
great diſorder; to which he briskly
replied, what ſhe ſaid I may thank you
for, Sir, and therefore it is but reaſon,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57792:112"/>
that what my Mother ſaid to me, I
ſhould ſay to you, <hi>Be ſure I ſee your
face no more,</hi> and ſo turned about and
left him: whereupon the Abbot call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after him, ſaid, Whither are you
going, good Sir? To whom, looking
over his ſhoulder, he anſwered, to
Church, whither he immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
with a ſad and dejected coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
which did much abate the joy
of the Congregation, who were much
pleaſed to ſee him accompany his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Duke of <hi>York</hi> thither; but
they partook with him in his ſorrow,
when they underſtood that, after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
he was to ſeek where to get a
Dinner, for which he muſt ſend to the
Cooks, or faſt, for there was a very
ſtrict Prohibition given to all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
in his Mothers Court, that they
ſhould not furniſh him with any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
or neceſſaries.</p>
               <p>That night, after Evening Prayer,
he had hopes to enjoy one moment of
ſatisfaction, by converſing with his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
the Princeſs <hi>Henrietta,</hi> afterward
Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans,</hi> during his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
abſence; but as ſoon as the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57792:112"/>
young Princeſs heard the news of his
deſigned adventure, ſhe was ſo fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into ſhrieks and tears, that ſhe cryed
out, <hi>Oh God, my Brother! Oh me, my
Mother! What? I am undone for ever:
What ſhall I do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which as ſoon as the Duke heard,
he retired, not being willing his dear
Siſter ſhould, by her kindneſs to him,
purchaſe her Mothers diſpleaſure. In
this diſconſolate condition he went to
his Lodging; when it was nine a Clock
at night, his Groom came to know
what he ſhould do with his Horſes, for
the Queens Comptroller was come to
him, with a charge, to remove them
inſtantly: whereupon the Groom plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
it was then too late, and that on
the morrow it would be time enough,
but the Comptroller replied, he ſhould
then be put out of his place e'er the
morning.</p>
               <p>The next day the Sheets were taken
off his Bed, finding therefore that he
could not be permitted to ſtay at the
Palace-Royal, he thought, until he
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57792:113"/>
could provide neceſſaries for his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
into <hi>Germany,</hi> to retire to the
Houſe of Mr. <hi>Crofts,</hi> (afterward Lord
<hi>Crofts,</hi> near <hi>Paris;</hi> whereof the Queen
hearing, ſhe check'd Mr. <hi>Crofts</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
willing to receive him, with which
he acquainted the Duke, but ſubmits
however to his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>In this ſtrait the Duke betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the advice of that faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to his Family, and zealous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi> by whoſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
inſtructions, he had received
much ſatisfaction in this his diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
condition; who, ſo ſoon as the
Duke had made known to him, that he
was not only turned out of his Mothers
Houſe, but that all perſons, who had
any dependency upon her, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
to receive or aſſiſt him: his
Lordſhip told him, if his Highneſs
would pleaſe to honour his Houſe
with his preſence, he ſhould there
be received with all the dutiful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that could be paid to him by ſo
ancient and faithfully devoted Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of his Royal Family; And with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57792:113"/>
an Entertainment as ſuitable to his
Quality, as the remains of that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
he had ſpent in his Father's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
would afford.</p>
               <p>But this the Duke, out of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty,
at firſt declined, alledging the
great hazard, which he knew he
would thereby run, of having his
Eſtate again ſequeſtred in <hi>England,</hi>
as well as by incurring the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the <hi>French</hi> Court, endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
his being exil'd that Kingdom,
for his kindneſs to him, as he had
been that of <hi>England,</hi> for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to his Father; and, perhaps, be
endangered in his perſon too, by the
fury of the Rabble, who might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
be animated by ſome en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
<hi>Papist,</hi> for thus diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, of making a Proſelyte of
him as they boaſted they had done,
and given Publick Thanks for it in
diverſe of their Churches.</p>
               <p>But his Lordſhip aſſur'd him, that
as he had hitherto ſpent the greateſt
part of his Life and Fortune in the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57792:114"/>
Service of his Royal Family, and the
defence of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, ſo
he would willingly ſacrifice the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of both on ſo honourable an
occaſion as that; with which hearty

               <p>Being thus gone from the Palace-Royal,
the Queen-Mother of <hi>France</hi>
came immediately thither, to try once
more, if ſhe could prevail with him,
to change his Religion; and as ſoon
as ſhe came, ſent her Son, the Duke
of <hi>Anjou,</hi> to viſit him; who return'd
with the News, that he was not to
be found: but as ſoon as it was known
where he was, ſhe ſent the Marqueſs
of <hi>Pleſſis,</hi> to perſwade him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

effecting whereof, he exerciſed all
his Parts and Elocution, with the

that ſince the death of his Father,
the Queen his Mother, had ſole Power

by their Reaſons, in great paſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
without the ſucceſs ſuſpected
at the Palace-Royal, where the <hi>French</hi>
Queen ſtayed very late, till he came
back: whoſe Report, when both
Queens heard, they were then ſo
fully ſatisfied in the Duke's firmneſs
to his Religion, that after that time,
no conſiderable attempt was made
on him, altho' he continued for near
two Months there; being nobly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
all that time by the Lord
<hi>Hatton,</hi> until, through his and the

From the interview of the Queen
of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which was held at a ſmall
Village near <hi>Frankford,</hi> (at the ſame

returned, with great ſatisfaction, to

all imaginable demonſtrations of Joy,
by the Magiſtrates and the whole

He return'd with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

by Poſt, with ſuch haſt and privacy,
that ſome mens hopes and others fears
imagin'd they were gone over into <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi>
an attempt at that time too
dangerous for ſo wiſe and politick a
Prince to adventure on. From <hi>Diep</hi>
he remov'd toward the Frontiers of
<hi>Spain,</hi> by the way of <hi>Roan,</hi> where he
was nobly treated by Mr. <hi>Scot</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Merchant, and entertain'd with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſuitable to his preſent condition;
and from thence he went by poſt to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jonne,</hi>
accompany'd by the Marqueſs
of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and ſo towards the two
Miniſters of State that were negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

at St. <hi>Jon de Luz.</hi> The news of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
did no ſooner reach <hi>Don Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi>'s
Lodgings, but he prepares to meet
him with as much ſplendour, as if our
Soveraign had been his Majeſty of
<hi>Spain,</hi> or himſelf an Engliſh Subject;
for when he met him, he immediately
alighting from his Horſe, and kneeling
(though in a very dirty and inconvenient
place) embrac'd and kiſſ'd his Majeſties
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57792:119"/>
Knees, and walk'd before him bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
to the place he had order'd to
be made ready for him, which was the
beſt Lodging the Town afforded; where
the next day he received a formal viſit
from that ſly, cloſe and reſerv'd Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician
Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> whom he
entertain'd with ſuch a diſcreet wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as if he deſign'd to let him know
(and thoſe that ſaw him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood

underſtood the walking <hi>Cabala</hi> almoſt
as well as he did himſelf.</p>
               <p>Never were any of his great affairs ſo
well carried on as that was, which he
manag'd himſelf; for by the advantage
of his own incomparable Prudence and
ſage Experience, together with his
powerful Majeſty and Preſence, he ſo
far prevail'd in his negotiations there,
that notwithſtanding <hi>Lockharts</hi> cloſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
in behalf of his Maſters,
he not only prevented any article that
was offer'd and preſt in favour of his
rebellious adverſaries of <hi>England,</hi> but
alſo procur'd himſelf to be included by
<hi>Spain,</hi> as the moſt honourable Ally
in the intended Peace, and obtain'd
a promiſe from both thoſe Favourites,
that they would in purſuance of their
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57792:119"/>
Maſters friendſhip with him, deſcended as
ſoon as poſſible, to treat of ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
that might be propoſed, as the moſt
ſutable to the promoting of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration,
and conſult what Counſels
ought to be taken, what Men, Money
and other ſupplys their reſpective Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
ſhould afford, and how each ſhould
be employed for the greateſt uſefulneſs
to his Service. After which he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
with as much Reſpect and Honour
as he was received.</p>
               <p>Whilſt this Treaty was managing by the
two Favourites; the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was,
in conſideration of his great worth, and
the Service he had done for <hi>Spain,</hi> offered
the honour of being made Conſtable of
<hi>Caſtile,</hi> and Lord high Admiral of <hi>Spain,</hi>
which he handſomly refuſed; that
Prince having a peculiar way of denying
requeſts as pleaſantly to ſome, as he
grants them to others. And indeed it
was at that time prudence in him to
wave any courteſie that might be prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
by <hi>Spain,</hi> or any other Popiſh Court,
leaſt it might ſomewhat have retarded
his Brothers affairs in <hi>England,</hi> by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring

Conſtancy to the reformed Religion?

faithfulneſs to the Proteſtant Religion and
Intereſt, to which they had adhered
with ſo much reſolution and conſtancy
that neither ſmiles nor frowns, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

fear of the heavieſt ſufferings; the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Favours from <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the baſeſt
Affronts from <hi>England,</hi> could tempt
them to the leaſt thought of diſloyalty
to it.</p>
               <p>The King having finiſht his negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
at the Treaty of St. <hi>Jan de Luz</hi> to
his great ſatisfaction, returned with his
Brother the Duke of <hi>York</hi> through
<hi>France</hi> to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> only ſtaying ſome

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57792:122"/>
the Gentlemen and Officers. <hi>Lambert</hi>
having obtained this victory, preſently
advanced with his Army to <hi>Cheſhire,</hi>
(where Collonel <hi>Croxton</hi> ſtill held out
the Caſtle) and had it preſently deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
from whence he advanced to
<hi>Liverpool</hi> which was yielded likewiſe by
<hi>Coll Ireland,</hi> and ſo was <hi>Chink</hi> and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
Caſtles, whereby that whole deſign
periſhed and came to nothing.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>George</hi> himſelf had made his eſcape
out of the Field, and got away, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with four of his Servants only in
diſguiſe, but being diſcovered at his Inn

One <hi>Gibbons</hi> who immediately
poſted away to give the Rump an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of it, was highly rewarded for
that acceptable news, and ſo were two
or three others, who were ſent before
from <hi>Lambert</hi> with the particulars
of the <hi>Cheſhire</hi> defeat; when he was
brought up to <hi>London, Fleetwood</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

                  </gap>t ſuch was his reſervedneſs and
reſolution, that notwithſtanding their
ſuſpicion, that the reſtoring of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57792:123"/>
King was at the bottom of it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<hi>Monk</hi> was ſaid to be privately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
with him in the ſame deſign. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
being reported to have been ſeen
about that time at his Houſe at <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keith,</hi>
that they could get nothing out
of him.</p>
               <p>When this deſign was about to be
put in execution, the King withdrew
himſelf privately from <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and lay
privately upon the coaſt of Brittany
about St. <hi>Malloes,</hi> to take ſhipping for
<hi>England,</hi> upon the firſt good event of
thoſe loyal undertakings of his faithful
Friends and Subjects; <hi>Kent</hi> or <hi>Eſſex</hi>
being deſigned for the place of his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
one <hi>Turene</hi> the French General
having engaged to wait upon him, if
he would command it; but the news
of this unhappy defeat reaching his
Royal Ears, which had been too long
accuſtomed to ſuch unfortunate and
unſuccesful ſtories, he returned again to
<hi>Bruſſels;</hi> reſolving for the preſent to
give over the proſecuting of his
Right by the ſword, and attend
the good effects of the Treaty between
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But being informed that affairs in
<hi>England</hi> were as unſetled as before, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57792:123"/>
that the Rump, and the Army wholly
applied themſelves to undermine and
ſubvert each other; he would not
wholly deſiſt from attempting to carry
on his intereſt there, by the help and
aſſiſtance of his Friends. And therefore
wiſely conſidering that <hi>Monk,</hi> who was
then General in <hi>Scotland,</hi> had formerly
been in his Fathers Service, wherein he
was taken Priſoner, and was thought to
embrace the Parliament intereſt, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his Ranſom was neglected, and that
during the whole time of his ſerving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them and the Protector, he had
not diſcovered any particular Spleen or
Malice to his Perſon, but had in all
things carried himſelf as a Soldier of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
only, who fought for his pay; he
conceived there might be ſome proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hopes of gaining him to his ſide,
if a dexterous application was made
to him, in regard he had not that
guilt which others had contracted, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by murdering of his Father, or
the malignity they had diſcovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
himſelf, to render him jealous
and ſuſpicious of him. And therefore
reſolving as near as poſſible to make
uſe of the moſt peaceable and bloodleſs
means to recover his loſt Dominions,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57792:124"/>
he ordered Sir <hi>John Greenvile,</hi> who was
one of thoſe Commiſſioners that reſided
at <hi>London</hi> for his ſervice, to find out
ſome way to treat ſecretly with him.
But before Sir <hi>John</hi> would proceed
therein, he thought it convenient to
inform him by whom, and in what
manner he had deſigned to do it, which
he did in a Letter written in Cyphers,
and directed to Sir <hi>Edward Hide</hi> at <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi>
with whom only he was by the
Kings order to correſpond; wherein
he propoſed the ſending of Mr. <hi>Nicholas
Monk</hi> who was Miniſter of his own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
of <hi>Kelkhampton</hi> in <hi>Cornwell,</hi> a living
of about three hundred pound <hi>per
Annum,</hi> which he had freely beſtowed
on him, without any other deſign there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
than only to oblige him to ſerve his
King and Country whenever he had
occaſion to employ him in any thing
that might tend to both their Good,
having even then an eye to the
General in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to whom he was
Brother, which contrivance the King
very well approved of, and left the
whole management of the buſineſs to
his ſecreſie and diſcretion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he ſent for <hi>Monk</hi> out of <hi>Cornwel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi>
and having firſt obliged him to ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57792:124"/>
accquainted him with the Kings
Commiſſion, to treat with his Brother,
the General, and his deſign of ſending
him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> to manage that treaty
on the Kings behalf, and gave him a
Commiſſion according to the Kings di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
(to offer his Brother, in caſe
he would undertake that commendable
and glorious work of reſtoring the
King to his Crown and Dignity) leave
to ſet down his own conditions, and
aſſure him that the King had promiſed
upon his Royal word to perform them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monk</hi> being fraught with hopes and
inſtructions, willingly undertook the
happy Embaſſy, embarquing himſelf
immediately for <hi>Scotland,</hi> and having
a proſperous gale, arrived in a few
days at <hi>Leith,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keith,</hi>
where his Brother the General
reſided. And that he might remove
all ſuſpition of the deſign of his coming,
from thoſe about the General, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that the intent of his voyage
was only to fetch away his Daughter
<hi>Mary,</hi> who at that time lived there in
the Generals Family, in order to the
beſtowing her in marriage to her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
hoping that his Brother would
make ſome con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iderable addition to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57792:125"/>
her Fortune. But the General being at
his firſt arrival engaged in buſineſs,
could not entertain him himſelf, and
therefore ſent him under the conduct of
an highland Foot-Boy, to his Chaplains
Chamber, which was Dr. <hi>Price,</hi> who
received him with that Courteſie that
became him, in regard of his relation
to his Maſter, and ſo ſoon as he had
made him ſit down, began to enquire
what news he had brought from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
about Sir <hi>George Booth,</hi> and the reſt
of thoſe loyal Gentlemen that were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
with him, to whom <hi>Monk</hi> made
ſuch replies as were ſuitable to his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
queſtions, and then having been
aſſured before he left <hi>England</hi> of the
Dr's. faithfulneſs and loyalty, he adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to acquaint him with the deſign
of his coming thither at that time, and
deſired his directions how he might,
to be with the greateſt advantage to
the Kings affairs, break that buſineſs,
and open his meſſage from Sir <hi>John</hi> to
the General, who thereupon told him
that his Brother would expect to be
ſatisfied of his Secreſie, as well as of his
Fidelity, before he would engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in ſuch a hazardous affair as that
was, ſince it was neceſſary that a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57792:125"/>
of that importance, ſhould ſleep in
as few Breaſts as poſſible, and he might
put himſelf, the General and his whole
negotiation into a very great hazard,
ſhould he rely too much upon the
Characters given him in <hi>England</hi> of the
ſecret loyalty of any perſons amongſt
them, adviſing him therefore to make
no more ſuch rude and unadviſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
of his Embaſſy, and to
acquaint his Brother with his having
related it to him, aſſuring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>him for
his encouragement, that he verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that his Brother would willingly
embrace any fair overture for the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of his Country from the ſlavery
of the Army. His Wife who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a great love and veneration for
the King, having prepared him to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in his behalf, when the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
ſhould offer it ſelf, and the
Soldiers, who troubled not their heads
much about Religion, and abbetting of
parties, but only fought for their pay,
having a general love and eſteem for
him, as looking upon him to be a good
Soldier, and a diſcreet Commander,
under whom they might ſafely engage;
he might at any time make himſelf a
good party amongſt them, when he
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57792:126"/>
ſhould judge it fit and ſafe to apppear.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> having in the Evening an
oppportunity to keep private with his
Brother, acquainted him with the end
of his coming, and the encouragement
propoſed by Sir <hi>John,</hi> if he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the work, aſſuring him that he
had ſeen the Kings Commiſſion dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to Sir <hi>John</hi> for the impowring of
him, to make thoſe offers, wherein he
promiſed, upon the word of a King, to
perform them: Which upon mature
deliberation he highly approved of,
and the more, becauſe he underſtood
that the Presbyterians and the Lord
<hi>Fairfax</hi> would be engaged with him;
with whom he ever after maintained a
private correſpondence; and therefore
from that time took up a reſolution to
endeavour his Maſters Reſtauration;
relying upon the Faith and Integrity of
Sir <hi>John Greenvile,</hi> and confiding in the
Kings Word, as much as if he had actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
received a Commiſſion from him,
for he ſoon after told his Chaplain that
he was reſolved to Commiſſion the
whole <hi>Scatch</hi> Nation againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Parliament and Army, rather than ſuffer
himſelf to be taken or diſplaced by
them; although he had at time no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57792:126"/>
authority to do it by, then that
airy commiſſion conveyed unto him by
word of mouth from Sir <hi>John Greenvile,</hi>
who had it in writing from the King:
And the happy ſucceſs of that reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was a great demonſtration of the
Kings extraordinary prudence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
in pitching upon <hi>Monk</hi> as the
fitteſt perſon to bring about that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and glorious revolution; and the
wiſdom of Sir <hi>John Greenvile</hi> in employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Brother, rather than any other
Perſon, to manage that great and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Intreague.</p>
               <p>And being informed that there was
a ſupplication preſented to the Rump
by <hi>Lambert,</hi> in the name of the Army
under his command, for the bringing
thoſe to puniſhment who had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
engaged in, or offered any aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
to <hi>Booth</hi>'s Conſpiracy, and for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing

had it been made, and a ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

would have yielded them

his reſolutions in practice, then he could
have reaſonably expected; for he eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
foreſaw what was the deſign and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of that ſupplication, and was ſo
well pleaſed with it, that he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
told his Chaplain, that he
perceived he ſhould ſhortly have a
better Game to play, than he lookt for
when he firſt engaged himſelf in the
deſign; and that he knew <hi>Lambert</hi> to
be of ſuch a reſtleſs and aſpiring temper
that he would not long ſuffer the Rump
to ſit in quiet at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore that he might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
make preparations for his future de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
he immediately diſpatcht away
his Brother to <hi>London</hi> in character of
an Envoy, to aſſure the Rump of his
faithfulneſs and fidelity to them, and
that he was reſolved to ſtand firm to their
Intereſt and Authority againſt all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
whatſoever: And for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
wipeing away all ſuſpicion of the
true intent and deſign of his Brothers
coming, he ſent his Daughter away
with him likewiſe.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had the General diſmiſt
his Bother, but he received a viſit from
a <hi>Scotch</hi> Noble Man, <hi>viz.</hi> the Earl of
<hi>Nitſdale,</hi> who after ſome private diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57792:129"/>
with him, aſſured him that the
King would be reſtored within the
compaſs of a very few months, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the ſhedding of one drop of Bloud,
or the hazard of a cut Finger in the
accompliſhment thereof; and that he
lookt upon him as the principle Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by whoſe Wiſdom and Conduct
it was to be effected; which prophet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
diſcourſe contributed very much
toward his encouragment, to puſh
the buſineſs forward with the greater
earneſtneſs and ſpeed.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Monk</hi> being ſafely arrived at
<hi>London,</hi> repaired privately to Sir <hi>John
Greenvile,</hi> and gave him an account
that he had delivered his meſſage to
the General and imparted it to none elſe
except his Chaplain only, but told him
as to the ſucceſs of it, he could give
him no account, being under an Oath
of ſecreſie. However Sir <hi>John</hi> thought
that was ſufficient, and therefore imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
acquainted the King with it,
who was ſo well ſatisfied therewith,
that he ordered him to wait an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
as ſoon as poſſible, to treat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally
with him, which he did not
long after, and received a more
full and ſatisfactory account from him
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57792:130"/>
how, and in what manner he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to proceed therein. And for
the diſcharging of this new Embaſſy
to the Rump, he repaired to Dr. <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi>
who was Brother in Law to him
and the General, and Agent for the <hi>Scotch</hi>
and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Armies, to whom he was orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the General to impart his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
to be delivered by him to the
Parliament, wherewith they were ſo
highly pleaſed, that out of a Sence of
the Generals ſuppoſed Fidelity, and to
require his offered kindneſs, (they made
as it were an expiring vote of revenge,
when they ſaw they muſt be forced to
yield to <hi>Lamberts</hi> ambition, and have
their uſurpt Authority ſuffer a ſecond
Rape) wherein they conſtituted him
about the ſeventh part of a Generaliſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,
which fell out very happily for
the promoting his great and generous
deſign; for it was by Virtue of that
power that he ſeemed afterwards to
act and give forth Commiſſions.</p>
               <p>And having received on the <hi>7th</hi> of
<hi>October</hi> the certain news that <hi>Lambert</hi>
had by the aſſiſtance of the Army, once
more unhouſed the Rump, he publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proteſted that he would not endure
that unjuſt and arbitrary proceding, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57792:130"/>
was reſolved therefore to reduce
the Military power to the obedience
of the Civil; and in order thereunto
preſently entred the Stage againſt <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
and his Armies proceedings, (diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching
away the truſty adjutant <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
Smith,</hi> who was afterwards Knigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for his Fidelity) that afternoon to
<hi>Edenburgh</hi> and <hi>Leith,</hi> to ſecure thoſe
places, and under the march of ſuch
Troops of Horſe on whoſe Captains he
could moſt rely; and having ſtopt the
Packquet, which ſhould have gone that
Night for <hi>England,</hi> he followed him
the next day to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where he
reformed his Army, making Captain
<hi>Morgan</hi> Lieftenant Collonel, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Nichols</hi> Major of his own Regiment,
and the next day ſent a party of Horſe,
commanded by Captain <hi>Johnſon,</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<hi>Barwick,</hi> which he knew to be a
place of great importance to his new
deſigns; which was done in the very
nick of time, for the Governour had
no ſooner clapt up his diſſenting Officers,
according to the Generals directions, but
Collonel <hi>Cobbit</hi> entred the Town, with
inſtructions and Authority to aſſert and
defend their Intereſt, who being brought
by <hi>Johnſon</hi> to the General, he ſent him
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57792:131"/>
Priſoner to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Caſtle; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
aſſured the Soldiers to him, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
three Letters into <hi>England,</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to <hi>Fleetwood, Lambert</hi> and <hi>Lenthal,</hi>
wherein he acquainted them with his
reſolution, to reſtore theſe Kingdoms
to the free exerciſe of their Laws and
Liberties; which expreſſion had more
included than was expreſt in it, which
was well enough underſtood by the
Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> and ſome others, who
were privy to the deſign.</p>
               <p>Theſe Letters gave ſome intimation
of hope to the Rump, that they ſhould
be a ſecond time reſtored to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and infinitely ſurpriſed <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
and the other Grandees of the
Army, who did not expect to meet
with any ſuch oppoſition, believing
it diverſly oppoſite to the intereſt of
the Army in general, for any one part
of it to be divided againſt, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the proceedings of the reſt; and
that although there ſhould be any
amongſt the Souldiers who ſhould
love their Country better then their
pay, and that <hi>Monk</hi> ſhould undertake
to back them; yet they were aſſured
by ſome of his Officers, who were
then at <hi>London,</hi> that his intereſt was
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57792:131"/>
too weak in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to make head
againſt them, however to make all ſure,
they ſent Dr. <hi>Clergies</hi> and Collonel
<hi>Talbut</hi> to him, whom they intreated
and conjured to uſe their utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors
to allay thoſe ſuddain heats
of his, which they affirmed had been
kindled by ſome unhappy miſtakes of
their proceedings; and aſſure him that
he and his army ſhould ſuddainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a ſatisfactory account about them.
But that attempt ſignified little, for
<hi>Talbut</hi> could not perſwade him of the
ſincerity of <hi>Lamberts</hi> Friendſhip, nor
the reallity of his offered advantages;
and <hi>Clergies</hi> did but prevaricate with
them that ſent him, and informed the
General of the true ſtate and condition
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, who had but
little Money, and no means left of
raiſing more, when that was ſpent, in
regard the Rump, who ſaw their doom
haſtning, had before they were turned
out by <hi>Lambert,</hi> voted it high Treaſon,
to raiſe money out of Parliament, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
covering their ſpite and revenge,
with the ſhadow of a pretended tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for their Countrys freedom. Theſe
were ſoon after followed by Captain
<hi>Dean,</hi> Treaſurer to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57792:132"/>
who was ſent by <hi>Fleetwood</hi> as a
ſpecial meſſenger of his own, with a
very kind letter to the General, and
an offer of what preferment in the
Army he would pleaſe to accept of, if
he would concur with them, which
he refuſed. This meſſenger in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
into <hi>Scotland,</hi> diſperſed divers
papers, where he endeavoured to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<hi>Monk</hi>'s Soldiers, by accuſing their
General of a deſign to bring in
<hi>Charles Stuart</hi> upon them, by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the Army, and told the General
to his Face, as he ſat at dinner with
him, that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> was at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of his deſign, upon which Dr. <hi>Price</hi>
replyed, no Mr. Treaſurer, it is you that
will bring him in, for by your late acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
you have more then juſtified the
late King, who demanded only the
Members of the Houſe of Commons,
but ye have diſſolved a Parliament.
And paſſing by one morning, as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

them them that Lord <hi>Lambert</hi> was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
upon them, and that all <hi>Monks</hi>
Army would ſuffice him for a Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt;
to which he received as blunt
an anſwer, That <hi>Lambert</hi> had certainly
a very good Stomack, if he could eat
Pikes and ſwallow Bullets.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:57792:132"/>
                  <hi>Lambert</hi> who waited not for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the meſſenger, but advanced
preſently towards the <hi>North,</hi> met with
<hi>Monks</hi> Commiſſioners at <hi>York,</hi> and would
have ſpared a farther Journey, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
them that he had power from the
Committee of ſafety, and the general
Councel of Officers, to treat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with them; but they reſiſting
upon the reſtauration of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to their former power, they
were diſmiſt, and ſo paſt forward to
<hi>London,</hi> whereupon Major General
<hi>Morgan,</hi> who was ſecretly a well wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to <hi>Monks</hi> deſigns but openly profeſt
a diſlike of them, told <hi>Lambert;</hi> if he
would ſend him into <hi>Scotland,</hi> he did
not doubt but he ſhould be able to
gain the General for him; which
offer he gladly accepted of, in hope
that he would either by his friendſhip
with <hi>Monk,</hi> create a better underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
between them, or by his power
and intereſt draw off a part of the <hi>Scotch</hi>
Army for himſelf, which he could have
eaſily done, had his diſlike of the
Generals declarations againſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies

feigned, his command there being next
to <hi>Monks.</hi>

                  <hi>Morgan</hi> being arrived in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
had the meſſage ſlighted, but his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
joyfully received of the General,
who much wanted him, and ſoon em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
him in the moſt difficult ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
that yet remained unattempted,
which was the reforming of his Horſe,
diſmounting diſſaffected Troopers,
and ſetting divers Foot Soldiers, of
whoſe Fidelity they were well aſſured,
on Horſeback. In the performance
whereof, ſome prevented their being
unhorſt, by running from their Colours,
and others by conveying them over to
the Enemy. So that having now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
all things in readineſs, he orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſeveral of his Troops to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the South of <hi>Scotland,</hi> intending
to follow them himſelf with the Body
of his Army.</p>
               <p>But before he left <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> he
called a Convention of the Nobility
and Burghers, and laid before them
the ground of his quarrel, requiring
their peaceable deportment, during his
abſence, and the payment of what
they were in arrear to him for his Army,
which they readily conſented to, and
appointed ſome of their number after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to wait upon him at <hi>Barwick,</hi> to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57792:133"/>
deſire him to furniſh them with Arms,
whereby they might be in a capacity
to aſſiſt him in oppoſing <hi>Lamberts</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion,
which ſeemed equally to threaten
both him and them; but he wiſely
declined that requeſt, and yet thinking
it not ſafe to ſend them away diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
granted them ſome things which
might contribute toward a publick peace
without prejudice to his deſigns.</p>
               <p>When he was got as far as <hi>Haddington,</hi>
he received information that his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,

a treaty with the Officers at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
upon conditions very unwelcom

whereof was, that the Kings Title

that ſome of thoſe Articles required a

known in <hi>London,</hi> the Members of the

toward them, and was in his way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bravely entertained by the Lord
<hi>Fairfax</hi> and ſeveral others, and at <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth</hi>
received a Letter from the Lord

ſent by their Sword-Bearer, to which
he returned a pleaſing though doubtful

               <p>But notwithſtanding all his ſolemn
proteſtations of adhering to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
intereſt, and the many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
he had thereupon received
from them, yet they were not well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in the reality of his Intentions,
ſuſpecting ſtill that there was ſomething
elſe at the bottom of his undertaking,
and therefore ſent <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinſon</hi> to
meet him at <hi>Harbrough,</hi> that under
pretence of congratulating with him,
for the good ſucceſs God had given to
his endeavours; they might the better
prie into his Actions, and diſcover ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
if poſſible, of his future intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
putting forth a declaration at the

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57792:135"/>
in the Favour of the People,
wherein they promiſed to perfect what
they had begun, for the ſetling of the
Nation. But they being now too long
uſed to their fair pretences, would be
deluded by them no longer, but ſeeing
they fell to their old tyrannies, under
a pretence of reſtoring them to their
loſt liberties; began to rouſe up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and ſhew their univerſal hatred
and deteſtation of their wicked and
arbitrary proceedings, by a general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to <hi>Monk,</hi> whom they looked
upon as a perſon of a more free and
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirit, beſeeching him in divers
addreſſes, which were preſented to him
in almoſt all the Towns he paſt through,
to aſſert their liberties, either by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
a full and free Parliament, or
elſe the Reſtauration of the ſecluded
Members of that which was then ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and promiſing to ſtand by him in
the maintenance and defence of their
freedom.</p>
               <p>Being come to St. <hi>Albans,</hi> which
was his laſt Stage, he ſent Collonel
<hi>Lidcot</hi> without conſulting <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon</hi>
(who had all along upon the
Road, taken upon them to give anſwers
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57792:135"/>
to the addreſſes preſented to him, and
for the better obſerving his actions, and
prying into his affairs, lodged in the
ſame Inn with him) to the Speaker,
to deſire that the Regiments who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ended
as Guards to the Parliament,
might be diſtributed into Country
Quarters, to make way for his coming
to <hi>London;</hi> which was not without
ſome difficulty obtained, although he had
hitherto carried himſelf with ſo much
evenneſs, that he had given them no
reaſon to diſtruſt him; and the whole
Army, with which he was to enter
the Town, was ſomewhat inferior in
number, to that which was to march
out, and leave their quarters to him:
He entred the Town at <hi>Grayes Inn-Lane,</hi>
the Bells ringing every where for Joy,
and as he paſt through <hi>Chancery Lane,</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he ſtopt at the Rolls, before the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
Door, who being not returned
from the Houſe, he marcht forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>White Hall,</hi> where his quarters
were appointed to be, and meeting
the Speaker in the <hi>Strand,</hi> he allighted
and complemented him after the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
Faſhion. But before he had bin
two days at his quarters, which were
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57792:136"/>
the Princes Lodgings, he was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with a ſecret information that
a Son of <hi>Secretary Scot,</hi> who lodged at
the Houſe of one <hi>Sturdy</hi> in <hi>Ruſſel-Sreet,</hi>
had upon diſcovery about the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
aſſured him that his power of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the Army ſhould be taken
from him within a few days, and that
he ſhould be ſent to the Tower, and
queſtioned for his Life; the only fact
whereof was, to make him the more
circumſpect and careful.</p>
               <p>The next day he went to wait upon
the Houſe, and received their Solemn
thanks by their Speaker, for the great
ſervice he had done in reſtoring of them,
but becauſe he took upon him to mind
them of ſome thing, which he judged
to be for the publick good, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them with the Addreſſes he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in every place, on his way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>London</hi> for a free Parliament,
or the Re-admiſſion of the ſeclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Members, they Reflected upon
him, as if he endeavoured to impoſe
his own ſence upon the parliament;
but however they eaſily paſſed it over,
and ſeemed to be content, to impute
it rather to his affection to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
than his diſtaſte of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57792:136"/>
and made him one of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of State, who was to order and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of all their publick affairs; but
before he was to take his place amongſt
them, he was to have, as well as the
reſt, an Oath impoſed upon him, to
abjure the Royal Family; but that being
abſolutely contrary to the Noble and
Generous Deſigns of that brave Patriot
of the Royal Cauſe, and bold Adventurer
for the intereſt of his injured Soveraign;
he oppoſed it as a thing altogether unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,
and by his influence upon Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Morley</hi> procured it to be ſo
warmly debated, that it fell to the
ground, and came to nothing.</p>
               <p>The General reſolving now to draw
his buſineſs toward a concluſion, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
himſelf to <hi>Scot,</hi> who had ſeveral
times complained to him of the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the City of <hi>London,</hi> to abate
their pride, and curb their inſolency,
as he termed it; the Lord Mayor, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
and Common Council of that
City, having by a publick Vote declared,
that they would pay no more Taxes
and Contributions, till the Parliament
was filled up with equal Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the People. A few popular
tumults from thence, had formely
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57792:137"/>
given the Government ſome diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances;
but now the whole City en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by their hopes and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
from <hi>Monk,</hi> rebelled againſt their
power, and <hi>Scot</hi> who was his greateſt
Enemy, and had plotted his ruine,
not being able to fadom the depth of
his deſign in that offer, and hoping
at once to ruine both him and the
City, prevailed with a Parliament to
ſend him thither, as well to bring the
Citizens into ſubjection, as to create
a hatred and jealouſie between him and
the General, by his executing that
odious and deteſtable work, wherein
they deſigned to employ him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being on Tuſeday night detained
at the Council of State till two in the
Morning; he there received orders
to march the next morning into the
City, to execute what was there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved
on, which although contrary
to his quiet and peaceable diſpoſition,
yet having a direct tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
his great deſign, he willingly
undertook it; and therefore in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
obedience to their commands,
early in the Morning marcht his Army
into the City, and having ceaſed on
divers of their Common Council and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57792:137"/>
others who had rendred themſelves
obnoxious to the Rump, and ſent them
to the Tower; he commanded his
Soldiers to dig up their poſts, and
break down their Gates and Port-Cullies,
which the amazed Citizens,
who flockt about him, ſuppoſing it had
been done to gratifie the Rump, durſt
not complain of, but with ſighs and
nods only, bid an eternal farewel to
their departing Liberty, as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.
And that the men at
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> might the better curb him,
when they had thus made uſe of him
to curb the City, they paſt a bill for
the Army to be governed by five Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
viz. <hi>Monk, Hazelrick, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
Walton</hi> and <hi>Allured,</hi> three whereof
were to be a <hi>Quorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus performed the Task
impoſed on him in the City, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
again to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
he was to have ſtayed for
farder order from the Rump, who had
more buſineſs for him to have done
there, and took it ill that he tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
not till he had performed it;
wherefore having aſſured the Tower
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57792:138"/>
by means of Coll. <hi>Morley,</hi> who was
then Lieutenant of it, and had offered to
give him the poſſeſſion thereof; he ſent a
Letter to the Rump, firſt ſubſcribed by
himſelf, and then by all the Officers of
his Army in their order, the tenour
whereof was very peremptory, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
them that they ſhould by the
Friday following ſend forth Writs,
to fill up all the vacant places in the
Houſe, and when that was done, fix a
time to terminate their own ſitting,
and give place to another Parliament
to ſucced them. <hi>Cromwel</hi> had outwitted
and unhouſed them by a power at firſt
derived from them; but <hi>Monk</hi> forced
them to unhouſe themſelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their own executioners. And
compelled them, by paſſing an Act for
their own diſſolution, and the calling
a new Parliament: He ſet the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
and the moſt diſcernable
ſtep toward the recalling their baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Soveraign, whom they had for ſo
many Years unjuſtly excluded from his
Throne. The Letter was ſent by two
Collonels, <hi>Coleberry</hi> and <hi>Lidcot;</hi> but
the General without ſtaying for an
Anſwer, immediately put himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57792:138"/>
the Head of his Army, and marcht
away into <hi>Finsbury</hi> Fields, requiring
the Mayor to provide him quarters for
his Soldiers within the City, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not the Breach between Him and
the Parliament, was ſomewhat aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
with the meſſage, but being ſoon
informed of the end of his coming, by
ſome Citizens, who had learnt that
news ſooner than himſelf, he gladly
complyed with that demand, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
him to dinner at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi>
where, in the afternoon were ſuch a
conference held between him and the
Mayor and Aldermen, that when he
entred toward the evening, at the head
of his Army, he was welcomed by the
Citizens as the Reſtorer of his Countrys
Freedom, with ringing of Bells, the
blazing of Bonefires, and the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Wine, and Money among his
Soldiers; the loud Shouts and Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
of the People, diſcovering their
publick joy, and the Fume of roaſted
Rumps, which were burnt in every
Bonefire, prognoſticating the downfall
of their Legiſlative power.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:57792:139"/>
The men at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> having cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
debated on the Letter ſent them by
<hi>Monk,</hi> thought it wiſdom to diſſemble
the indignation they conceived for that
Affront, and gave him thanks for his
joynt care with them, for the good of
the Common-Wealth; and to content
him if poſſible, ordered a Committee
to conſider what Lands were fitting to
be conferred upon him; iſſuing out a
Proclamation likewiſe againſt <hi>Lambert,</hi>
wherein he was required to ſurrender
himſelf within forty days on forfeiture
of his Eſtate; and promiſing with all
imaginable Speed to ſend out Writs
for a new Parliament; but reſolved
to tye up their hands by previous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
againſt the King, the Houſe
of Lords, and whatſoever elſe they
thought might prove injurious to them.
And the Council of State invited him
afreſh to take his place amongſt them,
urging that the neceſſity of affairs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
his preſence there, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
ſuch means as they thought had
the greateſt influence upon him, to
perſwade him to comply therewith:
Nor did he at firſt abſolutely deny
their requeſt, but only denied the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57792:139"/>
performance thereof, that ſo he might
keep them in ſuſpence, the better to
fix his Army, and prepare them hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to engage in his new deſigns, which
he thought could not be brought in
one day to part with all their former
Principles and Prejudices. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they ſtill courted his return, yet
fearing that he had deſigned nothing
leſs, they began to court thoſe who
who had formerly appeared againſt
them, and employed their adgitators
in that Army; which was by <hi>Monks</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful
Artifice, diſperſed into divers
parts of the Country, to whiſper his
Treaſon againſt the Parliament, and his
deſign to bring in <hi>Charles Stuart. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lzerick</hi>
was taxt by the General as the
principle Author of that device; but
he denyed it, and durſt not adventure
to Randeſvouz his Country Army
againſt <hi>Monks</hi> City Forces. And the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in the mean time were not idle, but
produced many infamous Libels againſt
the King, wherein he was impudently
abuſed, and charged with many unjuſt
Falſities, thereby to prevent the
Peoples entertaining any deſires of
his Reſtauration, but all would
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57792:140"/>
not do, the Country being now too
ſenſible of the groſs abuſes and
cheats that had been been put upon
the Nation by ſuch kind of Articles.</p>
               <p>But however the General being
willing to overcome them by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as well as force, eaſily conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to a propoſition preſented by
the Rump; that ſome of them might
meet a like number of the ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Members, and argue the buſineſs
in his preſence; which they did at
Alderman <hi>Whale</hi>'s his Houſe, which
was then his head Quarters; and they
having nothing to alledge againſt the
Re-admiſſion (beſides their love of
Power) but their own ſafety, the
ſale of publick Lands, and ſuch like
things, which they feared would be
diſturbed by their introduction. But
the ſecluded Members having ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
anſwered theſe objections, by
proteſting that they would diſturb
the properties and pretences of no
Man, but amicably ſit, and act for
the good of their Country, till by
their diſſolution they had made way
for another Parliament. And the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57792:140"/>
General being fully ſatisfied in the
juſtneſs of their Cauſe, left the City,
and returned again to <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
where thoſe of the ſecluded Members,
who were then in Town, reſorted to
him, and after a ſhort Speech made by
him, were conducted to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
where they took their former places
in the Houſe of Commons; ſome of
the ſitting Members, immediately upon
their entrance, riſing up, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in diſcontent, crying out, <hi>Monk</hi> had
betrayed them.</p>
               <p>The General having now forced the
Rump to admit the ſecluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
which had been ever ſince
forty eight forceably kept out of
the Houſe; they were no ſooner
ſeated therein, but they immediately
applied themſelves to ſuch kind of
work, as plainly diſcovered to all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
and diſcerning Men, where
thoſe things, which were then tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting,
would terminate; for they
preſently enlarged <hi>Monks</hi> Commiſſion,
making him General of all their Land
Forces, and conſtituted him joint General
at Sea with <hi>Mountague,</hi> diſcharged Sir
<hi>George Booth,</hi> and others Committed
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57792:141"/>
on account of his riſing, ordering the

And then having appointed a

and the Lord General, which Council
was ſo influenced by the General, that
all their Propoſals ran directly towards,
and naturally tended to ſwell the Royal
Stream, and make Soveraignty, which
had ſuffered ſo long and fatal an Ebb,
flow with that irreſiſtable, but yet inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and harmleſs force, that like a ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

But Sir <hi>John Grinvile</hi> being (in regard
he was a known Cavalier,) unable to
procure any private conference with
<hi>Monk,</hi> who was ſo extraordinary wary
and cautious, that when Sr. <hi>John</hi> had
ſpun out his Viſit to an extraordinary
length, in expectation of the Room be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
clear, by the breaking up of the
Company, yet then knowing the reaſon
of his long Attendance, he would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
riſe up from his Chair, and ſay,
Good night, Couzen, 'tis late; or by
ſome ſuch like pretence, excuſe himſelf,
and leave the Room. He was not able
to give the King any farther account of
the General's Intentions, and therefore
growing impatient of ſo many delays, he
bethought himſelf at laſt of making his
Application to Mr. <hi>Morrice,</hi> one of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecluded Members, who was ſomewhat
related to the General; and had a more
than ordinary Intimacy with him, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o he might by his Mediation obtain the
favour to diſcourſe a little with him in
private, concerning ſomething of great
importance to him and the Nation. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi>
was eaſily prevail'd upon to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the buſineſs, and immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
to the General, and acquainted
him with <hi>Greenvil</hi>'s deſire; but he ſtill
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57792:142"/>
refuſed to have any ſecret converſe with
him, for fear notice ſhould be taken of
it; yet ordered <hi>Morrice</hi> to wait upon
him, and try if he could inform himſelf
of the nature and quality of the buſineſs,
giving him leave to aſſure him, that
he was authorized by him to receive his
Meſſage, how weighty and ſecret ſoever
it might be, and promiſe to return the
Generals ſpeedy Anſwer thereunto. But
<hi>Greevile</hi> reſolving to treat with none but
himſelf, refuſed the Propoſal, without
giving him the leaſt intimation of his
buſineſs, telling him, that it concerned
none but the General himſelf, and that
ſo nearly, that it would admit of no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
delay. And if he ſtill perſiſted in
an obſtinate refuſing to admit him a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Conference, he muſt then be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated
to acquaint him with it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he met with him. Upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
whereof by <hi>Morrice,</hi> he was infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleaſed, and therefore ordered <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi>
to give him notice, that he would
meet him at his Chamber ſometime in
the Evening of the next day. <hi>Greenvile,</hi>
according to appointment, repaired to
<hi>Morrice</hi>'s Chamber, whither the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
upon intimation of his being
there, came likewiſe ſoon after. To
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57792:142"/>
whom, after ſome Complements, <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi>
declared, that he looked upon
himſelf as infinitely obliged to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
for giving him that opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of diſcharging himſelf of a Truſt
of great importance in relation to the
King, the General, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which had been long depoſited
in his hands by his Soveraign, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that he thought himſelf more
happy in having that good occaſion of
performing his duty, in obeying the
Commands and promoting the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
of his Soveraign, than in any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of his whole Life; preſenting
him at the ſame time with a Letter
directed to him from the King, and
producing another ſent to himſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with a Commiſſion which he
had received from the King to treat
with him about the buſineſs of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration.
Whereupon the General
ſuddenly ſtepped back, and holding
the Paper in his hand, with a kind of
a forced frown, haſtily demanded of
him how he durſt mention a thing of
that nature to him, without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the danger he thereby run himſelf
upon? <hi>Greenvile</hi> replied, He had long
ſince conſidered that matter, and duly
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57792:143"/>
weighed the danger which attended
an attempt of that nature; but the
hazard, though great, was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to deter him from the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of his duty. And that he was
the more encouraged to adventure, by
the Meſſage which he was pleaſed to
ſend him by his Brother, before he left
<hi>Scotland.</hi> Upon the mention thereof,
without making any reply, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
approached towards him with a
more pleaſing aſpect, and embracing
him in his Arms, ſaid, Dear Couzen, I
return you my hearty thanks for the
Prudence, Fidelity, Care and Conſtancy
wherewith you have managed this
great Affair, and your reſolute Secrecy
therein. For, could I have informed
my ſelf, that you had ever revealed
it to any perſon living, ſince you firſt
acquainted my Brother therewith, I
would never have conſented to treat
with you about it, which now I ſhall
moſt willingly do, and with you, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than any other, in regard you
are ſo nearly related to me, and I
have received ſo many obligations
both from you and your Family. And
then, having read the King's Letter,
and the Commiſſion, he added, that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57792:143"/>
he hoped the King would forgive what
was paſt, according to the Contents of
his gracious Letter, aſſuring him,
that his heart was ever faithful to
him, although he had never been in a
condition to ſerve him until then, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
Sir <hi>John,</hi> that he would in his
name aſſure His Majeſty, that he was
now not only ready to obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
but to ſacrifice his Life and
Fortune in his Service, calling <hi>Morrice,</hi>
who ſtood without as Door-keeper, to
bear witneſs of that his ſolemn Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation.
Sir <hi>John</hi> deſired him to ſend
ſome Confident of his own to the
King, to treat and adviſe with him
what was fit to be done for the better
carrying on their Deſign; to which he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſily conſented, but told him, that that
Confident muſt be himſelf, for he
would not, as yet, adventure to ſend
any Letters to the King, for fear of
the worſt. And that, without them,
the King had no reaſon to give any
Credit to a Meſſenger ſent from him,
but might very well believe one
whom himſelf had employed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at the next Conference he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Inſtructions, with a Charge not to
commit them to Writing, till he came
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57792:144"/>
to the King at <hi>Bruſsels,</hi> and there to
communicate them to none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Greenvile</hi> managed this Negotiation
with ſuch Secrecy, and his Journey to
<hi>Bruſsels</hi> was ſo ſpeedy and fortunate,
that few knew of it before his arrival
there; and thoſe who did, nay, that

what Errand it was he went on. The
King having intimation of his Arrival,
went privately to his Lodgings, to
whom <hi>Greenvile</hi> related the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
he had received from <hi>Monk,</hi>
which were readily believed, although
he brought nothing under the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's
hand. The News whereof was
very acceptable, and highly welcom
to the King, whoſe joy upon that
account was ſo much the greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the General required no Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Reſtraint to his Royal Power,
and had left the Reward of his Service
wholly to his goodneſs, as appeared
by what himſelf declared to <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi>
upon the receipt of a Letter ſent
him by ſome of his Friends in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to acquaint him with the great
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57792:144"/>
Service they had done His Majeſty
in prevailing with <hi>Monk,</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his being ſo abſolute a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths-man,
they knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his being pre-engaged by the

               <p>Little do they think in <hi>England,</hi>
ſaid the King, that the General and I

is, I could hardly believe it my ſelf,

content in doing His Majeſty and his
Country Service, than in the expectation
of greatneſs, preſſed <hi>Greenvile</hi> to know

he, according to the General's Example,
nobly refuſed all Propoſals of Reward
for that Service, in which he had been
ſo eminently ſucceſsful, till he ſhould
have the happineſs to ſee him at his
Palace of <hi>Whitehall.</hi> But the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
nor to ſend him back without a

into his Pocket a Warrant under his
Hand and Seal, for an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Earldom;
and the aſſurance of three thouſand
pounds <hi>per Annum,</hi> to be ſettled upon
him and his Heirs for ever, to ſupport
that Honour, with a promiſe moreover,
to pay thoſe Debts which either he or
his Father had contracted, by engaging
themſelves in the Royal Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The King, upon his receiving this
Meſſage from <hi>Monk,</hi> conſulted with Sir
<hi>Edward Hide,</hi> whom he had then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated

according to thoſe Directions <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi>

great ſpeed and privacy to <hi>Breda,</hi> a
Town belonging to his Siſter the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs

his departure from <hi>Flanders</hi> by the

Generals Commiſſion to be Captain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of all the Forces then raiſed, or

Seals and Signet, by which he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered

Publick Letters, which he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

he brought a Private one, directed to

King's own Hand, to which he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

was ſuperſcribed to the General himſelf, to

<hi>Birch,</hi> who was one of the Members,

               <p>The Parliament in the mean time

               <p>
                  <q>If one may judge of the content which
we have to ſee your Majeſty depart from
our Province, by the ſatisfaction we
had to poſſeſs you, we ſhall have no
great trouble to make it known to you;
your Majeſty might have obſerved in
the countenance of all our People, the
Joy they had in their Hearts, to ſee
a Prince cheriſhed of God, a Prince
wholly miraculous, and a Prince that
is probable to make a part of their
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57792:154"/>
quietneſs and felicity, your Majeſty
ſhall ſee preſently all the Streets filled,
all the ways covered, and all the Hills
loaden with People, which will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
you even to the place of your Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barquement,
and would not leave you,
if they had wherewith to paſs them to
your Kingdom. Our Joy is common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us with that of our Subjects, but as
we know better than they the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
value of the Treaſure we poſſeſs,
ſo we are more ſenſible of this ſad ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.
It would be inſupportable to
us, Sir, if we re-entred not into our
ſelves, and conſider not that it is the
thing of the World we moſt deſir'd,
and the greateſt advantage alſo that we
could wiſh to your Majeſty. We acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs
therein, becauſe we know that this
removal is no leſs neceſſary for us,
than glorious to your Majeſty, and
that 'tis not in your Kingdom, that we
muſt find the accompliſhment of the
Prayers we have made, and make ſtill
for you and us, ſo ſhall we not fail to
profit thence as well as from the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
which it hath pleaſed you to give
us of an immutable affection toward this
Republique. We render moſt humble
thanks to your Majeſty for them, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57792:154"/>
particularly for the illuſtrious proof
which it hath pleaſed you to give us
thereof, by the Glorious viſit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you honour'd our Aſſembly.
We ſhall conſerve the memory of it
moſt dearly, and make the marks of
that goodneſs to paſs to our laſt Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to the end they may acknowledge
it with the ſame reſpect, with which we
have received it. The appointment,
wherein we ſee your Majeſty ready to
take Horſe for the purſuit of your Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
forbids us to enlarge our ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſubject which would never wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
us, if we had words conformable to
our reſpectful ſentiments: but we have
no mind to encreaſe the juſt impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
which your Majeſty ſhall have to
ſee your ſelf return'd into your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
We pray God, Sir, that it be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
and happy, and that as he hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the Hearts and Affections of your
Subjects to acknowledge their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
and Lawful Prince, it will pleaſe
him alſo to command the Winds
and Seas to expedite your Voyage; and
that after you have arriv'd on your
own Coaſt, the ſame Prayers which we
ſhall reiterate, you may enjoy in your
Royal Perſon, and in your Poſterity
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57792:155"/>
for ever, all the Felicity and Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which your Humble Servants ſhall

conveyed the like mirth to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
Fleet, then riding at <hi>Scheveling,</hi> the
amazed Inhabitants flocking from all the
adjacent parts, and crowding to behold
the unuſual ſight, whilſt others poſted
themſelves more commodiouſly upon
the Downs and Sand-Hills, from whence
they might view the Fleet, ſee the King
Embarquing, and pleaſe themſelves with
beholding how he was Entertained by
the General at his firſt going on Board
the <hi>Charles,</hi> which had formerly been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>Naſeby.</hi> ſo that it was a difficult
thing to determine, whether the Wonder
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57792:155"/>
of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> or the Joy of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
exceeded: He was attended by his <hi>Aunt,</hi>
his Siſter, and ſome other Illuſtrious
Perſons on Board in a Boat prepared for
him by the States, whoſe Streamers and
Flags had this impreſs, <hi>Quo fas et fata,</hi>
alluding to, <hi>Dieu et mon droit;</hi> but upon
the approach of a <hi>Brigandine</hi> ſent from
General <hi>Mountague</hi> to receive him, he
entred therein, and ſo went on Board the
<hi>Charles,</hi> the Sea-men at his Entrance
ſeeming to be in an extaſie, for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now actually poſſeſs'd of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Prince. After he had been ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
while Entertain'd by the General, he
returned to the Poop, to view again, and
take his laſt Farewel of thoſe almoſt innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
multitudes that crowded on the
Downs and Sand Hills of <hi>Scheveling,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
merrily that he thought his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
could ſcarce have more tenderneſs
and veneration for him, than thoſe Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
in whoſe Affections he believed he
Reigned no leſs, than he was going to
Reign in the Wills of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Much
ado he had to part with the Princeſs of
<hi>Orange,</hi> whom many other conſiderations
beſides that of <hi>Birch,</hi> had rendreth moſt
dear to him, till at laſt the General ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all the Kings Retinue on Ship-board,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57792:156"/>
cauſed the Anchors to be weighed, and
the Sails to be ſpread, and then with Tears
and Embraces ſhe left him, and Rowed
back again with the ſame Company to
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Shore, and there loſt ſight of
her Brother and the Royal Fleet about
the Evening.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was the Fleet under Sail,
but the Cannon began to roar, giving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that the Lord of the Sea was in
his Rightful Poſſeſſion, which thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
continued till Night. Next day they
had little wind, but ſo much as on Friday
Morning they came within ſight of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi>
whereupon an Expreſs was ſent to
the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> General then at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to haſten
to <hi>Dover,</hi> which he did accordingly; and
about One of the Clock with a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Train came thither: About three
of the Clock in the Afternoon his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
landed at the <hi>Beach</hi> near the Peer of
<hi>Dover,</hi> with the Dukes and his Nobles.
Every man now put themſelves into a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
to obſerve the meeting of the beſt
of Kings and the moſt deſerving of all
the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Subjects, then the King dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
him with a <hi>George,</hi> which he put
about his Necks with his own Hand, &amp; the
Garter was tyed on by the two Dukes:
which Solemn and unexampled meeting,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57792:156"/>
did together with the joy thereof infuſe
a kind of fear, leaſt the King and the
General Congreſs ſhould fail in one part
or other in affection or Ceremony; but
when they met, their Interview diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with all punctillio's, except the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
kneeling, and the Kings kiſſing and
embracing of him, to the moſt pleaſing
Satisfaction both of Nobility and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Theſe complements being over, he
walkt upon foot with the General under
a Canopy, a Chair of State being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
carryed by his Coach-ſide. The
Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>Dover,</hi> great
numbers of Gentry, met him without
the Town; and after a ſhort Speech
preſented him a rich Bible with
Gold Claſps. Yet he ſtay'd not long
there, but took Coach for <hi>Canterbury;</hi> and
when he was got about two Miles out of
Town he left his Coach and Mounted
on horſe-back, the Dukes riding on his
Right hand, and the General on the left.
Bare, followed by <hi>Buckingham</hi> and
the reſt of the Nobility and Gentry, and
uncovered. In which poſture they came
to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where he was met and
complemented by the Mayor, Aldermen
and Recorder of that City, who having
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57792:157"/>
preſented him with a Gold Tankard,
conducted him to the Pallace, where he
ſtayed <hi>Saturday</hi> and <hi>Sunday,</hi> and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
early on <hi>Munday</hi> morning for <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
And arriving there early that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
went to <hi>Chattam,</hi> to ſee the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi>
and other Ships of the Royal Navy,
and returned again in the evening to his
Lodgings, where he was welcomed by an
Addreſs from <hi>Gib.</hi> his Regiment deliver'd
to him by the Collonel himſelf, which
was graciouſly accepted; and the next
Morning being the 29th of <hi>May,</hi> which
was his Birth-day, he ſet forward from
<hi>Rocheſter,</hi> the <hi>Militia</hi> forces of <hi>Kent</hi>
lining the wayes and the Maidens
ſtrowing herbs and Flowers, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the houſes through all the ſtreets he
paſs'd. And being come to <hi>Dartford,</hi> the
Officers of the Regiments of Horſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
him with an humble Addreſs,
wherein they declared their readineſs to
Sacrifice their Lives in defence of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
&amp; Government: the Army being drawn
up at <hi>Black-Heath</hi> he there took a view of
them, and us'd many gracious expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
towards them, which were anſwered
by them with loud and joyful Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and the ſeveral Regiments being
placed in order, he advanced toward
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57792:157"/>
                  <hi>London,</hi> and came about one of the Clock
to St. <hi>Georges Fields,</hi> where the Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
and Aldermen who waited there in
a Tent to receive him, delivered him
their Sword, which he re-delivered, and
Knighted Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> who was then
Mayor. After a ſhort repaſt, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>London</hi> through <hi>Southwark,</hi> and
ſo from the <hi>Bridge</hi> to <hi>Temple Barr,</hi> the
Streets being Railed on one ſide with
ſtandings for the Liveries, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Trained bands, through
which he paſſed in a ſplendid and Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
manner to <hi>White-hall.</hi> A Troop of
about 300 Gentlemen in Doublets of Cloth
of Silver, led by Major General <hi>Brown</hi>
marcht firſt, brandiſhing their Swords
in token of Triumph, being follow'd by
another of the like number in Velvet
Coats, with their Foot-men and Lacquies,
in Purple Liveries: then marcht the Troop
led by Coll. <hi>Robinſon</hi> in Buff-Coats with
Cloth of Silver ſleeves and green Scarves,
followed by another in blew Liveryes
and Silver Lace, their Colours being Red
fringed with Silver. Then marcht a
Troop with ſix Trumpets and ſeven
Foot-men before them in Sea-green
and Silver, their Colours being
pinck fringed with Silver; followed
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57792:158"/>
by another Troop whoſe Liveries were
gray and blew, under the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi>
having 30 Foot-men &amp; Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
four, their Colours being Sky,
with Silver fringed. Then marcht a Troop
in Gray Liveries of about an hundred
and five, led by the Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> having
ſix Trumpets and Colours of Sky and
Silver; followed by another of about Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty.
After theſe marcht a Troop of
about three hundred Noble-men and
Gentry led by <hi>Cleveland,</hi> followed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
of about one hundred with black
Colours, and after them marcht a Troop
of about three hundred Horſe, led by the
Lord <hi>Mordant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe being all paſt, two Trumpets
with his Majeſties Arms advanced with
the Sheriffs Men, being about Seventy-two
in number, in red Cloaks and Silver-Lace,
and carrying half Pikes. Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Gentlemen that rode out of
the ſeveral Companies of <hi>London,</hi> with
their reſpective Streamers, in Velvet Coats
and Gold Chains, every Company ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its Footmen with different Liveries,
being about ſix hundred. After them
came a Kettle Drum and five Trumpets,
followed by twelve Miniſters, then his
Majeſties Life-Guard advanced, being
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57792:158"/>
led by Sir <hi>Gilbert Gerrard,</hi> and Major
<hi>Raſcarrock,</hi> who were followed by the
City Marſhal with eight Foot-men, and
the City Waits and Officers in order, and
they by the two Sheriffs, and all the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
of <hi>London</hi> in their Scarlet Gowns
and Rich Trappings, attended with great
numbers of Footmen in Red Coats la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with Silver and Cloth of Gold. Then
followed the Maces and Heralds in their
Rich Coats, the Lord Mayor bare, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
the Sword, and the General and
the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> bare alſo, after
whom as the chiefeſt Ray of Luſtre to all
this Splendid Triumph, rode the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
between his two Royal Brothers,
having obſerved that order all along
from the very firſt overture of his return.
After them marcht a Troop bare with
white Colours, then the Generals Life-Guard,
and another Troop of Gentry,
and laſt of all marcht five Regiments of
the Army Horſe, with Back, Breaſt and
Head-Pieces, which diverſified the ſhew
with delight &amp; terror. This was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his paſſing through <hi>London,</hi> for
it is impoſſible for the moſt florid and
Ingenious Pen, to expreſs thoſe loud
Muſical and Raviſhing Notes of Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
and <hi>Vive-le-Roy</hi>'s which then
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57792:159"/>
filled the Mouths and charmed the Ears
of all his tranſported Subjects.</p>
               <p>Being in this manner brought to
<hi>White-hall,</hi> and the Lord Mayor and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
having taken their leave of him,
he went to the Banqueting Houſe, where
both Houſes of Parliament waited his
Arrival, and received him with thoſe
demonſtrations of joy and expreſſions of
Reverence &amp; humility that became them.
The Speakers of each Houſe in elegant
Speeches acquainting him with the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and happineſs they conceived in that
happy revolution, and the pleaſure they
took to behold his return in ſafety, and
thereby putting an end to that Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and Slavery which his Kingdoms
had ſo long endured.</p>
               <p>He thankt them for their expreſſions of
love and Loyalty, and told them that he
was ſo diſorder'd by his Journey, and
with the noiſe ſtill ſounding in his ears,
which he nevertheleſs confeſt to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to him, in regard it expreſt the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his People, that he was thereby
unfit to make them ſuch a Reply as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired;
adding, that the greateſt Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he took in that change, was the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his heart fully ſet to endeavour by all
means the Reſtoring the Nation to its
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57792:159"/>
freedom and happineſs, which he hop'd
by the advice of his Parliament to effect;
aſſuring them that next to the honour of
God from whom principally he deriv'd his
reſtoration to his Crown, he would ſtudy
the well-fare of his people, and not only
approve himſelf a true Defender of the
Faith, but alſo a juſt Aſſertor of the Laws
and Liberties of his Subjects. And having
taken leave of them, he retir'd to Supper,
and ſoon after to his reſt, where it was
time for him to find a ſweet and ſedate
repoſe free from the confus'd noiſe and
clamours of War, wherewith he had been
for twenty years together ſtrangely
toſs'd upon the boiſtrous Waves of fickle
and unconſtant Fortune.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>Friday</hi> following, he went by
Water in the Brigandine, which brought
him on board the <hi>Charles</hi> from <hi>Holland,</hi>
to the houſe of Lords, the Yeomen of the
guard making a lane for him to paſs
through, and the Heraulds at Arms in their
Rich Coats, the Maces and the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
bare-headed going before him. As
ſoon as he was ſeated, he commanded
the Commons to attend him, and having
in a ſhort, but elegant ſpeech, preſt them
to haſten the Act of oblivion, he ſign'd
ſeveral Bills which they had made ready
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57792:160"/>
againſt that time for the Royal aſſent;
the Firſt whereof was an Act for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of that Parliament; a ſecond for
a Tax of ſeventy thouſand pound <hi>per
menſem</hi> for 3 Months, and a third for the
continuance of Proceſs and Judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
And then he return'd to
<hi>White-Hall,</hi> where he choſe the Lords of
his Privy Council, amongſt whom were
ſeveral of the long Parliament, that had
given ſufficient, Teſtimony of their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
repentance, and their reſolution to
be Loyal for the future, and he appointed
Judges for the Benches and Courts
of Judicature. Several Addreſſes
were likewiſe made to him from the
Nobility and Gentry of all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
in <hi>England,</hi> wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated
his Reſtitution to his Crown
and Kingdom, aſſuring him of their
exceeding Joy and willingneſs to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his Royal Perſon and Authority.
Divers perſons that had been eminent
for their ſervice and affection to him,
were about that time alſo dignified with
the honour of Knighthood. And ſeveral
men guilty of his Fathers murder, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made their eſcape beyond-Sea, a
Proclamation was Iſſued forth, wherein
all thoſe perſons who had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Judgment, or any way aſſiſted in
that horrid and deteſtable fact, were
commanded to ſurrender themſelves
within fourteen days to the Speaker or
Speakers of Parliament, to the Lord Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yor
of <hi>London,</hi> or the Sheriff of that
County, wherein they then reſided, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
all perſons to conceal or harbour
them, under miſpriſion of Treaſon;
whereupon divers ſubmitted themſelves,
and were ſecur'd in the Tower.</p>
               <p>The Commons in drawing up the Act
of Oblivion, order'd, that ſome others
beſides thoſe who had actually ſate in
Judgment upon the late King, ſhould be
excepted out of it, <hi>viz. Broughton, Phelps,
Cook, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>

to them, wherein they confeſt their
guilt, and declar'd the artifices which
were us'd to draw them in, by which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
they obtain'd pardon upon ſome
ſmall forfeitures only. But <hi>Peters</hi> being
ſhortly after taken in <hi>Southwark,</hi> was
clapt up into the Tower. And the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not looking upon themſelves, nor
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57792:161"/>
the people of <hi>England,</hi> free from the guilt,
nor ſafe from the puniſhment which in
thoſe unhappy times they had contracted,
unleſs they laid hold of the Kings offer of
Grace in his Declaration from <hi>Breda,</hi> did
therefore reſolv'd in a full houſe, that
they did in the name of themſelves, and
of all the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> lay hold
on the gracious pardon mention'd in that
Declaration, with reference to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of ſuch as ſhould be excepted
in an Act of Pardon; and they order'd
a Declaration, that their Reſolution
ſhould be drawn up, which was done
accordingly, and preſented to the King by
<hi>Denzell</hi> afterward Lord <hi>Hollis;</hi> ſome
of the moſt eminent in Office under the
late Uſurpers, having in the mean while,
to make ſure of that Grace, gotten their
particular pardons exemplified under
the great Seal of <hi>England:</hi> To prevent
which trouble the King was more than
ordinary preſſing for the ſpeedy paſſing
the Act of Oblivion; taking care to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
his grateful ſentiments of the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
and ſervices of ſeveral Illuſtrious
perſonages, that were principally inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
in accompliſhing his Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by dignifying them with Places
and Titles of honour. And to ſhew how
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57792:161"/>
highly the Generals Loyalty had advanc'd
him in his good Opinion, he was dignifi'd
by him with the Titles of Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemarle,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Torrington,</hi> and Baron of
<hi>Potheridge Beauchamp</hi> &amp; <hi>Teyes,</hi> &amp; had his
Temples deſerv'dly incircl'd with a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Coronet by the hand of his Majeſty,
being thereby inveſted with the right of
Peerage in all the three Kingdoms:
whoſe equal Felicity, and Honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had
preferr'd before his own, and therefore
now moſt deſervingly ſhar'd with them
therein by his Inveſture in thoſe Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which were compleated on the 13th
of the following <hi>July,</hi> by his taking his
place in the Houſe of Lords, being atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Commons, and introduc'd by
the Duke of <hi>Buckingham. Montague</hi> was
made Earl of <hi>Sandwich, Ormond</hi> Earl of

Houſhold, the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> Lord
High Chamberlain, <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> L. Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain

               <p>Divers rich Preſents were now
made to him from the ſeveral Cities and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57792:162"/>
Burroughs of the Kingdom in Gold and
Plate, and the reſignation of ſeveral Feefarm
Rents, which had been purchas'd
from the Uſurpers, the City of <hi>London</hi>
among the reſt, with a Complement of
their good Stewardſhip, rendred their
grant of new <hi>Perk</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and all the

now ſecured from the late Purchaſers of
Crown and Church Laws, to the utter
diſappointing of their unjuſt and covetous
expectations from ſuch baſe and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable
Penny-worths.</p>
               <p>A Peace was now made &amp; Proclaim'd
between us and <hi>Spain,</hi> and a Splendid
Embaſſy diſpatcht from <hi>Denmark</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate

upon that happy and wonderful occaſion.</p>
               <p>And the Parliament having after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
debates and diſputes, alterations and

Act of Oblivion, which was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57792:162"/>
comprehenſive, and indulgent, (even

who found no better Argument to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
their acquieſcing therein, than their
unchangeable Loyalty to the King, whoſe

more excepted out of it, but only the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicides
and Murderers of the late King,
only <hi>Lambert, Vane,</hi> and twenty more

as ſhould be afterward declar'd by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
the principal whereof was <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelrick,</hi>
St. <hi>John Lenthal,</hi> the Speaker,
<hi>Philip Nye, Burton</hi> of <hi>Tarmouth,</hi> and
ſome Sequeſtrators Officers, and Major
Generals of the Army, among whom
was <hi>Desbrough, Pine, Butler, Ireton, &amp;c.</hi>
They likewiſe paſt an Act for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Anniverſary Thankſgiving on
the 29 of <hi>May,</hi> which was the day
both of his Birth and Reſtauration, and
therefore deſerv'd a perpetual memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and to be made by a Parliamentary
Canonization, the moſt auſpicious in
the Engliſh Kallender: to both which he
gave his Royal aſſent, and ſhortly after,
at their adjournment to another, for
disbanding the Army, and paying off
the Navy; which, although they
once threatned us with a perpetuating
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57792:163"/>
our ſlavery, yet were now forc'd by
the happy conjunction of his Fortune,
with his Wiſdom and Goodneſs, after
many models, to ſubmit to its laſt deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
And the Commons having after
the paſſing of their Bills, acquainted
him that they had nothing more to ask
or offer at that time, but that if his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
occaſions would permit, they
might adjourn and go into their own
Countries, where they ſhould endeavour
to make his ſubjects ſenſible of their
extraordinary happineſs in having ſuch
a King to Rule and Govern them; He
conſented to it, telling them, that
no man had long'd with more impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to have thoſe Bills paſt, than he
had done to paſs them; in regard he
look't upon them as the Foundation of
the Nations Peace and Security, and that
he did very willingly pardon all that
were pardoned in the Act of Indempnity;
but aſſuring them withal, that for the
time to come the ſame diſcretion and
conſcience which had diſpoſed him to the
clemency that he had therein expreſt,
and was moſt agreeable to his nature,
would oblige him to all Rigour and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
how contrary ſoever it were to his
Diſpoſition, towards thoſe who ſhould
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57792:163"/>
not now acquieſce, but continue to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
their Sedition and diſlike of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
not knowing any more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
way to aſſure himſelf of his peoples
affections, than by rendring himſelf juſt,
as well as kind to all.</p>
               <p>The confluence of his felicities were
about this time ſomewhat abated, and
the Joy of his Reſtauration ſomewhat
allay'd by the immature and much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
Death of his younger Brother
<hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> a Prince of
ſuch extraordinary hopes, that my ſilence
will be his beſt Commendation, ſince his

               <p>About this time the King knowing

Epiſcopcay, and reſtoring the Biſhops

So that the Eccleſiaſtical Regiment by
Biſhops recover'd its ſelf by the Kings

For the Parliament having in deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

For having arm'd themſelves, they came

and having order'd and muſter'd
their ſmall party, plac'd Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
one whereof kill'd an innocent

created great diſturbance, they kill'd ſome

where they lurkt for ſome time,
with a reſolution to make another
Inſurrection in the City, till they
were routed by a party of Horſe and
Foot, and about thirty of them
taken Priſoners, who being carried
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57792:167"/>
before the General, (the King being at

in their Helliſh Enterprize. <hi>Venner,</hi>
who was a <hi>Wine-Cooper</hi> by Trade, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them in his Sermon, which he
Preacht to ſtir them up, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

<hi>No Weapon fram'd againſt them

periſh;</hi> which their Impunity in their
firſt attempt deluded them to believe:
And therefore, ſo ſoon as the Watches
&amp; Guards were removed: On <hi>Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
morning they reinforced their <hi>firſt</hi>
enterprize, appearing at <hi>Thread-needle-Street,</hi>
and giving an Alarum to the
Trained-Bands, which was appointed
to watch all that day: A party of
whom being ſent againſt them, were
forced to retreat to their main Guard.
Whereupon the whole Company
marching in a body towards them,
they fled into <hi>Biſhops-gate-Street,</hi> where
happened a ſharp diſpute between
them, wherein two were killed, and
as many taken; the like number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57792:168"/>
killed and wounded of the Train'd-Bands.
Their next appearance was at
<hi>Colledg-Hill,</hi> from whence they March't
up into <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> and ſo into <hi>Wood-ſtreet:
Venner</hi> himſelf with a Murrion
on his head, and a Halbird in his
hand, being their chief Leader, where
there was the fierceſt action that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
during the whole Inſurrection;
for they fought it out ſtoutly with two
Companies of the Trayned-Bands, and
ſome of the Life-Guards Commanded
by the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
in very good Order and Diſcipline,

went down <hi>Wood street</hi> towards <hi>Cripple-gate,</hi>
firing in their retreat at the
Trained-Bands of Yellow, who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them in cloſe purſuit; ten of them
took into the <hi>Blew-Anchor</hi> Ale Houſe
by the <hi>Poſtern,</hi> which they briskly
maintained for ſome time; and when

Houſe, broke down ſome part of it, and
fired in upon them, they notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
deſperately refuſed to accept

Muſqueteers, firing their way up ſtayrs,
had ſhot down the door, and entred
the Room upon them, ſix of them
being kill'd before, and one upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
quarter then knockt down and
afterward ſhot with a Muſquet, the
reſt being demanded, why they craved

it was becauſe they durst not, for fear

them;</hi> to ſuch a prodigious height had
their reſolution and deſperation car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

               <p>The whole number of thoſe who
made this laſt Inſurrection amounted
not to about fifty Perſons, twenty
whereof were taken (beſides thoſe
killed) who were ſoon after brought
to their Tryal; at which it was prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that <hi>Venner, Tufney</hi> and <hi>Crag,</hi>
had ſeveral times perſwaded their

<hi>King JESUS</hi> againſt the Powers of

a Parliament, with whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to meet and conſult for the more
effectual healing the Breaches, uniting
the Differences, and redintegrating the
mutual Affections and Endearments,
which the unnaturalneſs and perverſe

was between the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> and <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Eighth</hi> of <hi>May</hi> being come,

the Commons to attend him
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57792:182"/>
there, and in a moſt pleaſant and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging

highly approved of by them, he

he had a fuller Bleſſing for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
which was his Natural Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
being called by His immediate

               <p>The Parliament at the ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,

for the aſſuring to his Subjects
whatſoever was contained and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
in His Declaration from <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
and the Act of Pardon, firſt began
with an Act for the Confirmation of
the Act of Oblivion, which being
done by the Free Parliament not
called by the Kings Writ, was thought
by the Guilty not to be valid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
ſecure enough to them; and that they
might by a wiſe proviſion before
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:57792:183"/>
hand, prevent all Objections and
Scruples which might otherwiſe have
been raiſed upon that account; They
Ratified and Confirmed all the other
Laws made therein, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to frame ſuch new ones as
were neceſſary for the better ſetling
and maintaining the Publick Peace;
wherein that for Regulating Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
as the moſt neceſſary, had
the Precedency, wherein Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
were Impowered to diſplace all
ſuch as bore Offices, and were any way
ſuſpected to be ill-willers to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and the Kings Authority, or
ſhould refuſe the Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi>
and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> or the Oath of <hi>Abjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
which was indeed at that time
the only, or at leaſt the chief Teſt
of Loyalty, in regard they were
therein to renounce the <hi>Solemn League</hi>
and Covenant, as unlawful in it ſelf
and illegally impoſed. But during
the Houſes Debate about that Bill, Mr.
<hi>Prin,</hi> who had alwayes indulged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
the liberty of Quarrelling with
every thing that any way ran coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

againſt the Priviledge of the

Houſe, whereof he was a Member,
from publiſhing his Reaſons againſt the

to <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> but the Commons
having Commanded their Serjeant at
Arms, to Seize the <hi>Printer,</hi> and <hi>Prin</hi>
owning himſelf to be the Author; he
was brought to the Barr, and ſeverely
rebuked by the Speaker; but upon his
humble ſubmiſſion, and the Houſe's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
reflection upon his great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
for the Reſtitution of the
King; he was remitted the Cenſure

by that over-ſight. And that
they might ſhew their reſpect and
veneration to the Prelacy, by reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it from the Oppreſſions, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of it from the Calumnies and
Reproaches of the late times, they
Repealed the Act of the 1 <hi>Caroli.</hi> 7.
which forbid the Biſhops medling in
Civil affaires and debarred them from
their Priviledg of Peerage in the

they were by this Repeal reſtored as
fully as ever they had been before.</p>
               <p>The free Parliament, having before

their deſolution, reſpitted the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſeveral of the Regicides; the
Parliament next reaſſumed the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of that matter, and having cauſed
the Lord <hi>Manſon,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Robert Wallop,</hi> to be brought
to the Bar, declared their Eſtates to
be confiſcated, and their Perſons and
Poſterity degraded from all Titles and

ſhould be carried back again to the

and after that, to ſuffer perpetual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.
And having now done
as much as could be expected from
them for the preſent, they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed

               <p>Theſe endeavours of the Parliament

of undoing all again: In order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,

The King out of a Noble and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous

his Friends, when it was out of his
power to reward their Perſons, and
conſidering likewiſe that the Living

               <p>The adjournment being expired,

of the Act of Repeal made in the

in Parliament; which the King
was very much pleaſed to behold;

did Congratulate with them for their
enjoyment of their former priviledges,
as a Felicity he had much deſired,
to ſee accompliſht in that goodly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
and re-eſtabliſht Fabrick of

that came in upon Proclamation,
and were upon that account reſpited
after Sentence to the Pleaſure of the

Bar of the Houſe of Lords, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
what they had to ſay, Why
Judgment ſhould not paſs upon them,
according to Sentence? pleaded the
Proclamation: <hi>Harry Martyn</hi> adding,
that he never obeyed any Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

he ſhould not be then hanged for
taking the Kings word; whereupon
they were remanded back again to
the <hi>Tower,</hi> till further Order. <hi>Ireland</hi>
having been hitherto governed by

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:57792:186"/>
and conſtant Attender upon the

nominated Deputy of that Kingdom;
and Epiſcopacy, after it had been ſo

befallen that Kingdom through the
Fury and Zeal of the <hi>Kirke,</hi> was
reduced with all gladneſs and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

               <p>This Royal Bride ſeems to have

a long Eclipſe by the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy for the

and had now newly recovered its
Splendor by her Fathers aſſuming
the Crown, which was almoſt as

ſtrange a turn of Providence, as that
of our Captivity, by his recovery
of his Dominions. On the <hi>14th.</hi> of

(in the <hi>Charles,</hi> which had brought

grief, and wipe away the Tears oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned

all the Misfortunes of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
which almoſt from the very
time of Her Marriage, in the Year
<hi>One Thouſand Six Hundred and Twelve,</hi>
had fallen very thick upon it. Her
death was followed with a moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
and Tempeſtuous Wind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
divers Perſons were killed, and
much damage done, as well in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
parts as in theſe Kingdoms,
as if Heaven had deſigned thereby
to intimate to the World, that thoſe
Troubles and Calamities, ſuffered by
that Princeſs and the Royal Family,
and by which moſt parts of <hi>Europe</hi>
had been tempeſted, were now all
blown over, and was like her to reſt
in a perpetual Repoſe. Several Bills
which were ready for His Royal

ſomewhat longer then he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
had their weight and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57792:188"/>
been of leſs importance, but in
regard their being paſt into Acts,
would ſet the Nation right, where
it was before the Troubles began,
by providing remedies againſt thoſe
miſchiefs which had then unhinged
the Kingdoms happineſs; ſuch as the
Forbidding armed or tumultuary Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and ordering that not above
Twelve ſhall reſort together at any

whereby they provided ſo far as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Wiſdom could foreſee againſt
the like dangers, by inſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
brought upon the Nation in the

               <p>But having once ſigned thoſe Acts,
and thereby furniſht his Subjects
with ſo many good and wholſome
Laws, as no Age of our fore-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
could ever boaſt of, he poſted
away to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> having ſent the
Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> thither before Him,
who was to conſummate the Sacred
Rights of Marriage, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

                  <hi>London</hi> in great Pomp and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.
The Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
having about that time, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
defraying his neceſſary Charge giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en

               <p>The <hi>Affrican</hi> Potentates, alarum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Arrival of the Engliſh,
and terrified by the Fame of thoſe
Warlike and Martial Atchievements,
began to fear, that if they ſuffered
them quietly to poſſeſs <hi>Tangier,</hi> they
ſhould thereby give them incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to incroach farther upon them;
which conſideration drew thither
<hi>Gayland,</hi> a War-like Prince, but then
a Rebel againſt the Emperour of
<hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> having uſurpt part
of his Dominions, who continued
there about for ſome time upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of entring into a League of
Friendſhip with them; but meeting
of a ſudden, as he was ranging with
his Horſe (who are accounted the
ſwifteſt in the World) with ſome
of our Forces, who were forraging
for Proviſions and Horſe-meat; he
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:57792:189"/>
ſurprized and defeated them; their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Fighting being to take and leave
as they find advantage, which they
do with very active and quick Force

and revenged the injury upon ſome

which he freely entred into, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed

And the King not long after made

               <p>The great diſcourſe and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>At <hi>Oxford,</hi> He was met half a

               <p>During his ſtay there, he viſited
the Schollars, and was Nobly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rertained:
But not long after His
return, notwithſtanding all thoſe
Proviſions for peace, he was informed
of a Plot diſcovered in the North,
to involve his Subjects in a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
which was to have begun firſt
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſo to have been
brought into <hi>England,</hi> and ſeveral of
the Conſpirators being taken, he ſent
down a Commiſſion to <hi>York</hi> in the
midſt of Winter to try them; Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
whereof were found Guilty,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57792:192"/>
the Chief of them was Captain
<hi>Oates;</hi> and ſhortly after divers more
were arraigned, the chief whereof
were <hi>Cotton, Denham,</hi> and <hi>Atkins;</hi>
ſome of them were executed at

Methods, for which a Printer was
Apprehended, Tryed and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and others pilloryed and Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> having notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their great pretences of Love
and Friendſhip to the King, been
guilty of many Injuries, and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; the
King and Parliament in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Spring, took into their Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
the many Complaints that
were made againſt them; and both
Houſes Petitioned the King to take a
ſpeedy and effectual courſe for the
redreſſing thereof, promiſing to aſſiſt
him therein with their Lives and
Fortunes. But he alwayes preferring
Peace before War, when it may be
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:57792:192"/>
had upon Honourable Conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to ſee what he could do with
them by fair means, before he let
things come to extremity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by his Agent there demanded ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for the injuries done by
them: But that ſubtle people not
willing to return a ſpeedy anſwer,
reſolved to ſend their own Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
into <hi>England;</hi> which, as it was
a way of anſwering more Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent,
ſo it occaſioned the greater
delay of time, which was the thing
they chiefly aim'd at, that ſo they
might be the better able to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
War, when they had made
proviſions for it: And he being
ſenſible of their drift therein,
thought it not convenient for him
to be altogether idle, and therefore
reſolved ſo to order his Affairs, as
to be in as good a readineſs as
they, whenſoever the War ſhould
commence. To which end he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the City, to lend him <hi>One
Hundred Thouſand Pound,</hi> referring
them to the Lord Treaſurer for
Terms of Repayment; which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
was receiv'd with ſuch a
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57792:193"/>
dutiful compliance by the Common-Council,
that it was preſently grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
thereby acquitting themſelves at
once, both in point of Loyalty and
Prudence, by ſerving the KINGS
preſent Neceſſity, and providing for
their own future Safety. This Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
he imploy'd in fitting out two
conſiderable Fleets: and intending to
employ Sir <hi>John Lawſon,</hi> who then
blockt up <hi>Argier,</hi> and ſome of the
Ships under his Command therein,
he commanded his Return for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
Captain <hi>Allen</hi> being ordered to
ſucceed him there; who brought
theſe Pirates into ſuch diſtreſs, that
ſhortly after they were forc'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of Peace upon terms advantageous
enough for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadour propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch conditions as were not to
be accepted, he ſent back Sir <hi>George
Downing</hi> thither, with full Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
how to behave himſelf towards
them; who had upon his Arrival
ſeveral Conferences with the States,
about Satisfaction for Damages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
but could not prevail with
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:57792:193"/>
them to return a poſitive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to any thing he propounded,
nor come to any terms of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
which they were the more
willing to delay, in regard they
expected the ſpeedy Arrival of a
vaſt Treaſure in ſeveral great
Fleets of Merchants Ships. But
this being not unknown to him,
and he being a Prince that well
enough underſtood, how ſtrong the
Nerve of War, Money, was, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to way-lay thoſe vaſt Maſſes
of Wealth as they paſt home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
through his own Channel,
eſpecially being informed by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Intelligence, that they were
reſolved in contempt of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to ſend their <hi>Guiney</hi> Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
by Sea, and that <hi>Opdam</hi>
ſhould convey them through the
Channel. To which end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that he might be before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
with them in their prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
he endeavoured with all
imaginable ſpeed and diligence
to make his Navy ready, not
ſparing to overſee and order
things with indefatigable paines and
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57792:194"/>
induſtry in his own Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which was abundantly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
by the ſucceſs. For ſuch
was the Alacrity of his Subjects
when they ſaw him continually
Travelling from place to place,
to forward the work, and ſee all
things effectually and ſpeedily
performed, encouraging them by
his Preſence; that the City at
the very firſt mention of it by
the Earl of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> [Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain
of His Houſehold,] ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
him with a ſecond Loan
of <hi>One Hundred Thouſand Pounds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which means, while the
<hi>Dutch</hi> flattered themſelves with
ſuppoſitions of his want of Men
and Money, and his being brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
with the Calamities of the
Raging Peſtilence (which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
about this time, and was the
ſevereſt that ever was known in
<hi>England,)</hi> they were only forced to
look on and with Envy behold
his Vigorous preparations, and
ſee the Sea covered with ſuch a
Magnificent Navy, as the Ocean
had ſcarcely ever ſupported in
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57792:194"/>
any former Age. However having
duely conſidered the dangers of the
Northern paſſage, they ſeemingly
laid aſide all thoughts of going
about by <hi>Scotland,</hi> and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
firm to their former Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of forcing their paſſage
though the Channel. In order
whereunto, having Re-victualled
<hi>Opdams</hi> Fleet, they commanded him
to haſten to Sea, with the firſt Wind,
and conduct the <hi>Guiney</hi>-Succors
through the Channel, having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
ſome other Ships from the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lie</hi> and <hi>Texel</hi> to Joyn with him,
and ſent a Galliot before to give
notice to their Director General,
in <hi>Guinea</hi> of their Proceedings
therein. Which Reſolution taken
and carryed on with ſo much
Vigour, moſt men Imagin'd to
have been extorted from them
by the exigency of their preſent
condition; for they had ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many baſe contempts upon
the King and Subjects of <hi>England.</hi>
Nor was the Iſſue of that Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vado,
other than what their
Fears preſented: For about the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57792:195"/>
middle of <hi>October,</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>
appeared at the <hi>Spitt-Head</hi> with
ſixteen Saile of Ships, who was
not long after joyned by the
Duke, then Lord High Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of <hi>England,</hi> and the Earl of
<hi>Sandwich;</hi> ſo that it was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the greateſt difficulty and
hazard for them to unlock the
narrow Seas. And great diſpute
there was amongſt them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Opdam,</hi> who lay with his
Fleet in the <hi>Gore,</hi> ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
out or no; but the
Wind continuing croſs put an
end to that diſpute, and furniſht
them with a plauſible excuſe for
their not appearing at Sea upon
ſo great diſadvantages as they
would in all probability have
met withall: However Prince <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert</hi>
kept the Sea with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Fleet to attend their Motion,
and was rewarded by all or moſt
of their <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> Fleet falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his hands, which with other
Prizes taken that Year by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
amounted to about <hi>One Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Thirty Five.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:57792:195"/>
There having been as yet no
Publick Declaration of War on
either ſide; the King ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to Treat for Peace, with
His Arms in His Hand, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Sir <hi>George Downing</hi> to preſs,
in the heat of all that preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and action, for ſatisfaction
of Damages: And finding that
they were not like to be brought
to ſuch terms as he expected,
and knowing that it would
mightily advance his Credit, and
ſtrike Terror into his Enemies to
be alway before hand with them,
he cauſed an <hi>Embargo</hi> to be laid
upon their Ships, with ſo much
Secrecy, that His Embaſſadour
there had notice of it, at leaſt
eight dayes before the States,
that ſo he might give ſecret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
haſten their departure; by which
means, when their <hi>Embargo</hi> came,
it found only two ſmall inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Veſſels, and an Oyſter Boat
to ſeize. And the King acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Parliament (which met
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:57792:196"/>
in <hi>November,)</hi> how unkindly he
had been Treated by the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
and what preparations he had
thereupon made for War, and telling
them he had out of his own Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
ſet forth a Navy, which he
was ſure would not decline meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with all the Power of the
<hi>Dutch;</hi> for the Finiſhing where
of, he had borrowed ſo liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of his own ſtores, and of
the City of <hi>London,</hi> that to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the one, and repleniſh the
other, would require little leſs then
<hi>Eight Hundred Thouſand Pounds;</hi>
They to demonſtrate their Love
and Affection to their Soveraign,
and how hearty they were in
their Reſolutions to ſupport His
Honour, and their Countries Rights
againſt Forreign Encroachments;
gave him more then thrice that
Summ in an Act Entituled, An
Act for granting a Royal Aide of
<hi>Twenty four Thouſand Threeſcore
and Seventeen Thouſand and Five
Hundred Pounds.</hi> And finding that
the <hi>Dutch</hi> did but trifle with him,
in hopes of gaining time, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:57792:196"/>
to forbear them no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and therefore in the <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
following denounc'd War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them by a Publick Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
prohibiting all Manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res

granting Letters of Reprizal to
divers of his injured Subjects. And
to increaſe his Fleet, a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now made, both with <hi>Gayland</hi>
and the <hi>Algerines,</hi> he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Ships in thoſe parts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn

from Port to Port, to haſten
his preparations and encourage the

the bleſſing of God, who is
the Lord of Navies as well as of
Hoſts, was implored by a general
Faſt enjoyned by Proclamation, and
obſerved with Reverence ſuitable
to the Solemnity of the occaſion,
which was anſwered with the
happy Omens of future Victory,
from the fair ſucceſs of ſmaller
enterpriſes, three of their Men
of War being ſhortly after ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p>His Royal Highneſs the Duke
of <hi>York,</hi> who as Lord High Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of <hi>England</hi> commanded that
Fleet, growing impatient of the
<hi>Hollanders</hi> ſtay, reſolved to give
them a viſit upon their own
Coaſt, and <hi>One Hundred and Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi>
Saile of Ships made for the
<hi>Texel,</hi> within five Leagues of
which place he came to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,
where he took a full view of
their Fleet, ſome of the ſmalleſt
of his Ships running within two
Leagues of the Shore: and ſome
few dayes after, he ſhewed himſelf
before the Mouth of their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:57792:197"/>
which gave them ſo great
an Allarum that they preſently
erected Beacons all along the
Coaſts to give notice if he ſhould
make any attempt to Land. He
ſtayd ſomewhat longer then he
intended, in hope to provoke them
to come out and engage; but not
ſuceeding therein, he commanded
ſeven of his Ships to ſaile in queſt
of a Fleet of Merchant-men, who
were then coming home from
<hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and had certainly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into their hands, had not a
great fogg which aroſe about that
time prevented it: however, ten
of them were taken, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more at ſeveral times after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>However the <hi>Dutch</hi> finding their
Embaſſadors in <hi>Swedeland</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
able to effect little, meeting
with Ceremonious entertainments,
but no Aſſiſtance, reſolved to ſhew
their own ſtrength; and their
Navy appeared upon the Ocean
in all its Glory and Splendor, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into ſeven Squadrons, being
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:57792:198"/>
in all about <hi>One Hundred and Three</hi>
Men of War, <hi>Eleven</hi> Fire-Ships,
and ſeven Yatches: About which
time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſuffered ſome loſs;
for their <hi>Hamburgh</hi> Fleet deſiring
a Convoy of the Duke, when he
lay before the <hi>Texel,</hi> he ſent
them ſome Ships for their Conduct
and Security, with a Caution,
that if they were not ready to
Saile within ten dayes, they ſhould
not after that time adventure to
Sea; but the ten dayes being over
before they could get ready, and
the Ketch ordered by him to give
them notice of his removal from
the <hi>Texel</hi> miſſing them, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
to Sea, contrary to his
Inſtructions and Orders, and ſo
fell into the Enemies hands. But
that loſs was abundantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated
by the Victory which
ſoon after enſued, wherein the
<hi>Dutch</hi> loſt eighteen of their beſt
Ships which were taken by the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> beſides ten more which
were ſunk and burnt. Which ill
ſucceſs cauſed many diſorders and
complaints among the Common
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:57792:198"/>
People in <hi>Holland;</hi> for the appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof, and the revenging
themſelves upon their Officers, that
were accus'd of Cowardiſe, or ill
management in that Engagement,
they queſtioned ſeveral of them
for their Lives, and cauſed three
of their Captains to be Executed
at the Helder, two to have their
Swords broken over their heads,
and the Vice-Admiral <hi>Cortinaer</hi>
to ſtand upon a Scaffold with a
Halter about his neck.</p>
               <p>But the Joy of this Victory
was ſomewhat allayed by the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which now began to grow
very hot in <hi>London</hi> and its Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs;
inſomuch that the Queen
Mother, to avoid its Fury return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

who having taken his leave of

But the Plague increaſing in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>

               <p>But tho during the time of that

City, and that he might not be thought

the Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> who in all the

<hi>White-Hall,</hi> with a Courage equal to
his Dignity. And knowing that as
the Affliction came from the hand
of Heaven, ſo none but the Almighty
was able to mittigate or remove it,
He commanded by Proclamation a
general Faſt to be obſerv'd through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Kingdom, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
and bewailing thoſe ſins that
had brought that heavy Judgment

commanding his Biſhops to direct

as were moſt ſuitable not only for
the Service of that Particular day,
but likewiſe of all the ſucceeding
<hi>Wedneſdays,</hi> ſo long as the Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that day in every week to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
as a Faſt for the removal of
that deſolating diſtemper, according
to the Apoſtle's Rule, praying alwayes
and with all manner of Prayer.</p>

                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:57792:200"/>
The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet having now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
their Dammages, and ſeveral of
the <hi>Dutch</hi> Prizes being fitted for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
put to Sea again, and ſtood over
for the <hi>Holland</hi>-Coaſt; the alarum
whereof brought back <hi>Bankert,</hi> who
had been about three Weeks at Sea
with ſome of their Ships, and cauſed
them to make <hi>de Ruyter,</hi> after his
long expected arrival from the <hi>West,</hi>
Admiral of their Fleet. But the Biſhop
of <hi>Munſter</hi>'s Drums (who then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
threatned them with a War)
ſounding in their Ears, almoſt as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly
as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cannon, made them
order a flying Army to the Frontiers,
tho' with little ſatisfaction to the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Inhabitants, who daily fled to the
fortified Towns for their ſecurity.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Fleet, in three Squadrons, ſailed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Norway;</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>
having notice, that fifty <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
had ſheltred themſelves in <hi>Berghen,</hi>
ſent a Squadron of twenty two Men
of War, under the Command of <hi>Tydde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
to attack and fire them in the
Harbour; which Enterpriſe had proved
very fatal, had not the Wind befriended
them, and the <hi>Dane</hi> permitted them
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:57792:201"/>
to plant their Guns on ſhore, againſt
the reſolute <hi>Engliſh;</hi> however, they
received very great dammages, and
had many of their beſt Ships in that
Harbour diſſabled; And the Earl him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
meeting with a Convoy of theirs,
who had ſeveral Merchants, and ſome
<hi>East-India</hi> men in his Company, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked
them with ſo much reſolution,
that notwithſtanding the ſtormineſs of
the Weather did much favour them,
yet he took Eight of their Men of
War, two of their beſt <hi>East-India</hi>
Ships, and twenty Sail of their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;
and ſome few days after, the
Fleet encountering with eighteen Sail
of the Enemy, took the greateſt part
of them, with above one thouſand Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.
However, the <hi>French</hi> King,
ſuppoſing the Ballance of Affairs not
yet even enough, and affecting a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi>-Sea, not
only continued his friendſhip to them,
but, in their behalf, declared War like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
againſt <hi>England,</hi> upon pretence
of ſuccouring them, according to the
Conditions of the Treaty in 1662;
which Declaration the King, who,
altho? he was as great a lover of Peace,
as any Prince in the World, yet being
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57792:201"/>
provoked, would not be behind hand
with his Enemies, ſoon returned with
the like denunciation of War againſt
him; proteſting, that he was reſolved
to proſecute that War againſt <hi>France,</hi>
with his utmoſt force by Land and
Sea: And it was admirable to behold
the cheerfulneſs and alacrity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Maritine Countreys offered
him their Service, upon their firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
his Orders to put themſelves
into a poſture of defence; but being
unwilling to continue them under the
trouble and charge of a needleſs Duty,
he diſmiſs'd them for the preſent, and
only ordered them to be ready, if there
was occaſion.</p>
               <p>The Peſtilence being now pretty
well abated, he returned again to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
where he was joyfully recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and welcomed by the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen; about which time
eight perſons, formerly Officers or Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in the Rebellion, were Indicted
at the <hi>Old-Bayly,</hi> for conſpiring the
Death of the King, and the Alteration
of the Government; having, in his
abſence from the City, plotted the
ſurpriſal of the Tower, killing the
General, <hi>Robinſon</hi> and <hi>Brown;</hi> and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:57792:202"/>
then, according to their old levelling
humour, to have declared for an equal
diviſion of Lands: The better to effect
which Deſign of theirs, the City was
to have been fired, the Portcullices to
have been let down, to keep out all
aſſiſtance, and the Horſe-guards to
have been ſurpriſed in their Quarters;
the Tower having been viewed by
them, and its ſurpriſal ordered by
Boats over the Moat, and ſo to ſcale the
Wall. One <hi>Alexander</hi> was the chief
Conſpirator, having diſtributed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sums of Money amongſt them;
and he told them, for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of ſeveral great ones, that ſat
continually in <hi>London,</hi> and iſſued out
all neceſſary Orders; which Counſel,
he ſaid, received their Directions from
another in <hi>Holland,</hi> who ſat with the
States: The third of <hi>September</hi> being
found, by a Scheme erected for that
purpoſe, a lucky Day, a Planet then
ruling, whoſe direful effects, portended
the downfal of Monarchy, was pitch'd
upon for the Attempt: They were
found guilty of High Treaſon, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted

               </p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemarle,</hi>
being made joynt Generals at

Sea, for that Summer's Expedition, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the Fleet; the Prince command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the blew Squadron, wherewith he
ſailed toward <hi>France,</hi> upon intimation
that the <hi>French</hi> were haſting to joyn the
<hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, and the Duke the other
two, who meeting the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> on
<hi>Friday,</hi> about 4 or 5 Leagues from the
<hi>North Foreland,</hi> couragiouſly attacked
them, notwithſtanding he had not
above half their number, bravely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Fight two days, and part of
the third, when he had been hardly
put to it, had not the Prince, hearing
the Guns, tacked about, and made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him. Upon his approach, <hi>de Ruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſent out 30 ſtout Ships, to intercept
him, and prevent his joyning the Duke;
but avoiding them, he haſtened for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and ſent <hi>Albemarle</hi> word, that if
he liked the deſign, he would keep the
wind of them, and engage the 30 Ships
<hi>de Ruyter</hi> had ſent againſt him; but
the Duke not liking his purpoſe, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him rather to joyn the Fleet, which
he did, and the approaching night, ſoon
after put an end to their farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
And the next morning, ſo
ſoon as it grew light, they perceived
the <hi>Dutch</hi> to be fled, and gotten almoſt
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57792:203"/>
out of ſight, St. <hi>Georges Chanel</hi> having
proved too dangerous and ſtormy for
them; but making all the ſail they
could, they purſued them, and the Prince
with his freſh Squadron, falling in with
them, with an undaunted courage
and bravery, paſs'd five ſeveral times
through the whole Body of their Fleet;
ſo that not able longer to endure it,
with all the ſail they could make, they
began to run, and ſheltred themſelves
in their ſhallows. But both Fleets ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
repaired their dammages, got out
to Sea again, and meeting ſoon after,
begun a ſecond Engagement, no leſs
bloody than the former, both ſides
fighting with all the Courage and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
that could be expected from the
moſt inveterate and enraged Enemies,
<hi>de Ruyter</hi> reſolving to revenge his loſt
diſgrace, and recover, if poſſible, his
loſt honour; and the Prince, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
his former, by obtaining a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Victory; They began to fight
about Nine in the Morning, pouring
Broad-ſides upon each other, with
ſuch fury, that the roaring Canon
ſeemed to outvy the Thunder, and
the Smoak clouded the Sun, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the Air more dark and diſmal,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:57792:203"/>
than was black <hi>Munday.</hi> There might
have been ſeen the Heads of ſome, the
Arms, Leggs and Thighs, of others,
ſhot off; ſome divided in the middle
with Chain-ſhot, breathing out their
laſt in anguiſh and pain, or burning in
Fired Ships: whilſt others, expoſed to
the mercy of the Liquid Element, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored
pity from their very Enemies,
whom they intreated to ſave their
Lives, although with the loſs of their
Liberties. But in the midſt of all thoſe
deplorable miſeries, the ſurvivers fought
with as much reſolution and fury as
ever; their Courage and Valour being
rather heightned than daunted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:
For which Victories, a ſolemn
thanks giving was obſerved throughout
the whole Nation.</p>
               <p>But to abate the joy of the <hi>Engliſh,
London</hi> which had flouriſhed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſo many Ages, and been accounted
one of the goodlieſt Cities in the World,
was about this time deſtroyed, and burnt
down to the ground, by a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

the Beaſt mentioned in the <hi>Revelations,</hi>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:57792:204"/>
had filled all Men with great expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſome memorable accident that
would fall out therein: many eminent
Writers having, with more confidence
than truth, Predicted the fall of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi>
and the utter ruin and deſolation
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which they affirmed to be the
Apocalyptical <hi>Babylon.</hi> It began at a
Bakers Houſe, in <hi>Pudding-Lane</hi> near
new <hi>Fiſhſtreet,</hi> a place very cloſe, and
for the moſt part conſiſting of old Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Houſes, which burned like ſo many
pitch'd Barrels; whereby it ſpread it
ſelf with ſuch an impetuous and irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
fury, that notwithſtanding all
endeavours to extinguiſh it, it exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it ſelf to all the ſeveral quarters of
the City, and by <hi>Wedneſday</hi> night con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
that goodly Pile: The King and
the Duke, during all that time, riding
from place to place, and by their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
care and labour, encouraging all
Men to attempt the putting a ſtop to its
fury and rage, which was at laſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
performed at the <hi>Temple</hi>-Church,
<hi>Pye-Corner, Holborn-Bridg, Alderſgate,
Cripplegate,</hi> at the Church in <hi>Fenchurch-ſtreet,</hi>

at the <hi>Tower-Dock.</hi> But on <hi>Thurſday</hi> in

again at the <hi>Temple,</hi> by the accidental
falling of ſome ſparks upon a Pile of
Timber Buildings, and might have done
much more harm, had not the Duke,
who watch'd there in Perſon all that
night, and ſo encouraged the People
with his preſence, that by blowing up

before day. It conſumed, acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

was valued at nine Millions, and nine
hundred thouſand pound Sterling.</p>
               <p>In ſo deplorable and amazing an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
it is not difficult to imagine how
many Perſons were conſtrained, in haſt
and confuſion, to remove their Goods
into the Fields, and take up their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57792:205"/>
in the open Air; which gave the
King (whoſe heart was ever open to
compaſſionate the diſtreſs and miſeries
of his Subjects) an opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
his commiſeration, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the Juſtices of the Peace
to ſend Proviſions into the Markets,
and opening his Sea-ſtores for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of the poor and neceſſitous.</p>
               <p>The Fire, happening at a time
when <hi>England</hi> was engaged in a
War with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> was
thought, by many, to be a treacherous
Act contriv'd and perpetrated by the
<hi>French,</hi> which ſome were the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
to believe, in regard one <hi>Hubert,</hi>
a melancholly <hi>Frenchman,</hi> confeſt he did
the fact, by putting a Fire-ball into the
Houſe of the Baker where it began.
And <hi>Oates,</hi> the Diſcoverer of the <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca</hi>
Plot, lays the guilt of that action,
upon a knot of <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and <hi>Iriſh-men;</hi>
who having laid the project long before,
could not put it in execution 'till that
time: notwithſtanding which [for we
are not to believe all that the Doctor has
been pleas'd to ſwear] it is uncertain, to
this day, whether ſome caſual accident,
or the malice of thoſe who envied the
happineſs and grandeur of that City,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57792:205"/>
were the immediate occaſions of it. But
however it were, it was permitted by
Heaven for a Puniſhment, of its Pride,
Luxury and Rebellion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>London</hi> being thus conſumed and laid
in Aſhes, the grieved Inhabitants look'd
upon its Rebuilding as ſo weighty and
ponderous an undertaking, that they
deſpaired of ever living to ſee it begun,
much leſs finiſhed, and therefore took
Houſes, in the out-parts, at vaſt Rents
and Fines, and for a long term of Years.
Nor might their fears have been altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
groundleſs, had it happened in a
time leſs happy and fortunate: but liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a Reign of Wonders, they found,
contrary to all mens expectations, that
it ſuddenly ſtarted up rather than was
gradually built, in far more ſplendour
and beauty than ever it was before.
And that fire, wherein all their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
ſeemed to have been for ever buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
proved a real advantage, by reaſon
of that provident care which was
thereupon taken by the King, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
ſuch fatal accidents for the future,
by commanding all the buildings, which
were for the moſt part before of Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to be now made of Brick or Stone;
and ſo contrived, that if a Fire happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57792:206"/>
in any of them, it might be hem'd
in, within the Walls of that particular
Houſe, without indangering the adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Buildings, by putting the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of each Pariſh, and divers prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Merchants and Gentlemen, that
live in that City, upon providing
greater plenty of large and hand
Engines, Buckets, and other ſuch
like things neceſſary for the quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Fires; And by making Men
more expert in the methods of ſtopping
the progreſs of any Fires that ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
for the future; and finally, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſeveral ingenious Perſons upon
contriving and ſetting up an Office, for
the Enſuring of Houſes from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
by fire for thirty one years, at
five pence <hi>per</hi> pound for Brick Houſes,
and ten pence <hi>per</hi> pound for Timber
Houſes, which is to be diſcounted by
way of purchaſe, and five years only
paid down for eight; ſeven for twelve;
nine and one half for twenty one; ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for thirty one years Inſurance: ſo
that it is in reality but little more than
three pence <hi>per</hi> pound for Brick Houſes,
and ſix pence <hi>per</hi> pound for Timber
Houſes, only requiring ten pounds in
Mony to be paid to the Inſurers toward
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:57792:206"/>
the defraying of their Charges in
Re-building the Houſe ſo often as it
ſhall happen to be burnt down, within
the term enſured. And becauſe many
Perſons take Leaſes of Houſes for diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
terms of Years, they do not tye any
Perſon to Inſure for thirty one, but ſo
many Years only as themſelves pleaſe,
ſetling ſeveral Ground Rents, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
other ſufficient Proviſions for the
ſecurity of the Subſcribers. This Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
they ſetled in <hi>Thredneedle-ſtreet,</hi> in
the back-ſide of the Royal Exchange,
and it is certainly one of the greateſt
deſigns that any Age hath ever produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and will prove more univerſally

by that means, to contribute toward the
repairing of thoſe that are burned.</p>
               <p>In order to the re-building <hi>London,</hi>
the King, according to his accuſtomed
Wiſdom, foreſeeing it would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be impoſſible to have it uniform,
and decide the Controverſies which
would ariſe about dividing the Ground
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57792:207"/>
belonging to each Houſe, and oblige
the Repairers to build with Brick or
Stone, provided an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for the ſetling all things in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
thereunto, and the erecting a
Court of Judicature, to judge and
determin all Differences that might
ariſe between Party and Party; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
in the mean time the haſty
building any publick Edifices, and
proclaiming a general Faſt through
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> ordering the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
of thoſe who were ruined
thereby to be then recommended to
the Charity of all well-diſpoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
and the Money ſo gathered, to
be afterward diſtributed by the hands
of the Lord Mayor. The Act was
paſs'd in the approaching Parliament;
wherein, beſides the proviſion for the
building the Houſes of Brick or Stone,
it was enacted, That the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Streets ſhould be of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
breadth; and thoſe toward the
Water-ſides, wide enough to render
Paſſages convenient; that a fair
Wharf ſhould be left all along the
River's-ſide, and no Houſes built
thereon, but at a convenient diſtance
appointed therein; none whereof were
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57792:207"/>
to be inhabited by Dyers, Brewers,
or Sugar-Bakers: And that an exact
Survey ſhould be made of the Ruins,
for the ſatisfaction of particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts,
and a Model framed of the
whole Building, the better to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
if it were convenient for them to
appoint any alterations therein.</p>
               <p>And to ſhew his Pious Care for
the Rebuilding of the Churches for
the Service of God, as well as Houſes
for his Subjects to dwell in, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
that Work to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and magnanimous Bounty of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
ſpirited Perſons; and for an
encouragement to others, promiſed
to Rebuild the Cuſtom-houſe, and
Enlarge it for the Benefit of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
at his own Charge, which
he afterward performed, engaging
to part with all his Right and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
ariſing from his own Lands
within the City; for the Publick
Good, and to remit the Duties ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
from Hearth-Money, to thoſe
who ſhould Erect any New Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
according to his Declaration,
for Seven Years: And to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
his Reſolution to perform what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he had promiſed in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:57792:208"/>
commanded one <hi>Knight</hi> to
be committed to Priſon, for preſuming
to Print certain Propoſitions for the
Rebuilding the City, with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Advantages to the Crown,
which were repugnant to his gracious
Offers in that Declaration.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>London</hi> being aſhamed to
lye longer ſmothered under Aſhes,
when all thoſe Proviſions were made
for its Reſurrection, was by Sir <hi>Jonas
Moore,</hi> according to the appointed
Model, firſt rouſed in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet;</hi>
and from that beginning, grew ſo
haſtily towards a perfection, that
within the compaſs of a few years,
it outvyed all its ancient Glory and
Splendour, and appeared far more
beautiful in its riſe, than its fall had
rendred it abject and deſolate.</p>
               <p>But the burning of <hi>London</hi> was
not the only unhappy Accident that
fell out in that Year of Wonders;
for the Fire, which had laid the
City in Aſhes, threatned the Court
with the like diſſolation; for having,
by the misfortune of a Candle fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into the ſtraw, violently ſeized
upon the Horſe-Guard, in the <hi>Tilt-Yard,</hi>
over againſt <hi>White-Hall,</hi> it burned
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:57792:208"/>
down the North-Weſt part of that
Building, but being ſo cloſe under
the King's own eye, it was by timely
help in a little time maſtered: And at
a place called <hi>Welbourn,</hi> in <hi>Lincoln</hi>-ſhire,
after a prodigious Thunder, with
Hail-ſtones of a more than ordinary
bigneſs, there followed ſuch a Storm
and Tempeſt, that its violence threw
down moſt of the Houſes to the
ground, tore up Trees by the Roots,
and diſperſing ſeveral Ricks of Corn
and Hay, paſſed to the next Village,
called <hi>Willington,</hi> where it threw
down firm Houſes, and going forward
to <hi>Nanby,</hi> it fell ſo violently upon the
Church, that it daſh'd the Spire in
pieces, and ſo tore and rent the Body
of the Church, that it almoſt levelled
it with the ground. And that <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
might likewiſe bear a ſhare in
that Year's Calamities, a Seditious
Zeal, having inſpired ſome Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,
with revenge againſt Sir <hi>James
Turner,</hi> for executing (too vigorouſly,
as they pretended) the Laws againſt
them, they committed an inſolent
Ryot upon his perſon, taking him
out of his Bed, and carrying him
naked into the Market-place, where
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:57792:209"/>
they were hardly reſtrained from cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him in pieces, which Tumult
was firſt raiſed by a ſmall and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable
Rabble, but in a ſhort
time increaſed to a Body of One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
ſix hundred Men, who march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
toward <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> were encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and defeated near <hi>Glencarn,</hi>
many of them being ſlain, and more
taken; the Ring-leaders whereof
were executed, and moſt of the reſt
pardoned.</p>
               <p>But in the midſt of all theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Diſtractions, he did not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the making all neceſſary Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
for carrying on and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his War with <hi>Holland, France,</hi>
and <hi>Denmark;</hi> the latter whereof was
now entered into a League offenſive
and defenſive with the States of the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> upon pretence of
the Aſſault made upon the <hi>Dutch,</hi>
in his Port of <hi>Berghen,</hi> although he
had the freedom of that Port frankly
offered him by the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>
himſelf, at a time when he thought
nothing of it; and that in order to
the doing thoſe very Acts of Hoſtility,
wherewith he was then unjuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
by that King, as he declared
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:57792:209"/>
in his Declaration of War againſt
<hi>Denmark,</hi> publiſhed about that time;
And for a good <hi>Omen</hi> of his future
ſucceſs, he not long after his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of War, received News,
that the Vice-Admiral of <hi>Denmark</hi> was
taken by ſome of his Frigots, upon the
Coaſt of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
become a Mediator for Peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him, and the <hi>States-General,</hi> and
prevailed with him to condeſcend
thereunto, and appoint <hi>Breda</hi> for the
place of Treaty; the <hi>Dutch,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
buſied themſelves in making
Preparations for continuing the War,
reſolving to treat of Peace, in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
and condition to fight, if it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not, and (he not being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of their intentions) to make
him ſpend that Summer in needleſs
Expences for War, and only keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon his own guard. But we having
therefore but a ſmall Fleet abroad, the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> upon intimation thereof, got
out to Sea betimes, and finding no Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to reſiſt them, made an attempt
on <hi>Burnt Iſland,</hi> but being beaten off
with loſs, they next attempted the
Fort of <hi>Sheerneſs,</hi> which being then a
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57792:210"/>
place of ſmall force, was after a ſhort,
but ſtout reſiſtance, abandoned by
Sir <hi>Edward Spragg,</hi> and ſo the Mouth
of that narrow River was left open
to them: And being encouraged by
this ſucceſs, they landed about three
thouſand men near <hi>Felton</hi>-Cliff, and
with two thouſand of them adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to make two Aſſaults upon <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard</hi>-Fort,
but were beaten off, and
forced to retire in ſuch haſte, that they
left their Scaling-Ladders behind them,
and had about one hundred and fifty
ſlain upon the place; the other thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
which were left behind the Cliff,
to ſecure their retreat, being encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by the Trained-bands, under
the Command of the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi>
a ſmart Skirmiſh paſs'd between them,
and continued till Ten at Night,
when it was renewed again by the
return of the beaten Companies from
the Fort; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe not
being able to come up, there was
not that execution done upon them,
which otherwiſe might have been.
However, the <hi>Dutch</hi> lik'd not that
hot Service well enough, to abide
their coming, but as ſoon as their
Boats were afloat, embarqued with
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:57792:210"/>
all haſte, and returned to their
Ships, and ſailing for the <hi>Humber,</hi>
they engaged a Squadron of the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> which they found there;
but being worſted, ſhewed themſelves
before <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and made ſome
ſlight Attempts in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and
<hi>Cornwall:</hi> And after <hi>de Ruyter,</hi> their
Admiral had been civily treated in
the <hi>West,</hi> by the Earl of <hi>Bath,</hi>
and Sir <hi>Jonathan Trelawney,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
advice, that the Peace was
concluded, they ſailed back for <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Peace was concluded at <hi>Breda,</hi>
upon the twenty firſt of <hi>June,</hi> in the
Year 1667. when the Articles were
ſigned by the ſeveral Plenipotentiaries,
and upon the fourteenth of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Ratifications thereof
interchanged, the Mediators firſt bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ratifications and other Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of the <hi>Dutch, French</hi> and
<hi>Danes,</hi> into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Embaſſadors
Lodgings, and received theirs in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change:
which done, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
went into the apartments
of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and their Allies, where
they made and received the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
uſual in ſuch caſes, and the Peace
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57792:211"/>
was thereupon immediately Proclaimed
before the Doors of the ſeveral Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiaries;
and on the twenty fourth
of that Month at the <hi>Exchange,</hi> which
was then kept at <hi>Greſham</hi> Colledge, and
other places in <hi>London.</hi> But the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> in <hi>Cornhil,</hi>
being about that time appointed to be
laid, the King was pleaſed to ſhew his
readineſs to countenance that Work, by
being preſent at, and aſſiſting in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
thereof, with his own Royal
hands; as his Brother, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi>
did, ſhortly after, who laid the firſt ſtone
of the ſecond Pillar: which Edifice
was in a ſhort time finiſhed, and is now
the moſt curious Fabrick of that kind
in the whole World.</p>
               <p>About this time, that wiſe and uſeful
States-man and Privy-Counſellor, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Hide,</hi> Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and Lord
High-Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> who had
always behaved himſelf with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Loyalty and Faithfulneſs to his
Maſter, as well before, as after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration,
falling into diſgrace with
the Parliament, was forced to abſcond;
and leaving that Office, which he had
ſo long managed, with advantage to
the King, and honour to himſelf, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:57792:211"/>
into <hi>France,</hi> where he lived in a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Exile 'till he died.</p>
               <p>A ſort of idle and licentious Perſons,
getting together in the Holy-days at
<hi>Eaſter,</hi> and pretending former cuſtom,
took the liberty to pull down ſome
Houſes of bad repute, about the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs
of <hi>London,</hi> under the notion of
Apprentices; yet others being found
guilty of it, four of them were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
Tryed, Condemned and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
and two of their Heads ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Bridge for a terror to others.</p>
               <p>Having diſpatch'd the Earl of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile,</hi>
as his Embaſſador Extraordinary
to the Court of <hi>Sweden,</hi> with which
King he always maintained a friendly
correſpondence, he directed a Letter
for the Earl, when he was at <hi>Copenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
on his way to <hi>Sweden,</hi> to be by him
delivered to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to an obliging Letter he had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before received from him; which
Letter of the King's, was ſo acceptable
to the <hi>Dane,</hi> that upon the Earl's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
he immediately diſpatch'd orders
to all his Ports and Towns of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
eſpecially thoſe in <hi>Norway,</hi> for
reſtoring the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to the ſame Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Priviledges in Trading thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57792:212"/>
as they had before the War. And
the Earl, upon his arrival in <hi>Sweden,</hi>
preſented that King with the <hi>George</hi>
worn by the Knights of the Garter; and
after his having been entertained in
that Court with all imaginable reſpect,
upon his Maſters account, and diſmiſs'd
with particular marks of the King of
<hi>Sweden</hi>'s favour, and teſtimonies of the
acceptableneſs of his Embaſſie, he was,
upon his return home, ſolemnly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled
in that Order at <hi>Windſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While the King was diverting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
this Summer, with the Duke and
others of his Nobles, in the new For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> he received the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
tidings of his Mothers death at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbe,</hi>
the thirty firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nobly buried, in the <hi>December</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
at St. <hi>Dennis.</hi> And to cloſe the
publick affairs of this Year, the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
of the Crown to the King, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
to the Kingdom, <hi>George</hi> Duke of
<hi>Albemarle,</hi> and Lord General of all
the Kings Land Forces, exchanged his
temporary Coronet for an Eternal
Crown; and the King, as a mark of
Gratitude to the Father, ſent his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to his Son and Succeſſor, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Duke of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:57792:212"/>
in many of his Honours and
Preferments, promiſing withall, that
himſelf would take care of his Fathers
Funeral which he accordingly did: and
after he had publickly lain in State at
<hi>Somerſet-Houſe</hi> for ſome time, cauſed
his Funeral to be ſolemnized with that
Pomp and Splendor, that, it is verily
believed, no Subject was ever honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the like.</p>
               <p>In the following Spring, the King
having a great deſire to unite <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>England</hi> into one Kingdom,
endeavoured to have it accompliſh'd,
by procuring an Act of Parliament, in
order thereunto, and nominating Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
for each Kingdom, to meet
and treat about it: But they not being
able to agree, it was wholly laid aſide,
and came to nothing.</p>
               <p>The King's Wiſdom and Conduct
being famed throughout all parts of
the World, like a ſecond <hi>Solomon,</hi>
drew to his Court ſeveral Foreign
Princes, to ſee and admire him; And
about this time the Prince of <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany</hi>
came upon the ſame Errand,
and was by him treated both at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
and <hi>Windſor,</hi> with great Reſpect
and Splendour, and by ſeveral of his
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:57792:213"/>
Nobles, in his Progreſs through <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the chief Cities whereof he
was deſirous to take a view of; after
which he departed for <hi>Holland,</hi> and
ſo returned into his own Countrey:
where, not long after, beſides his
ſplendid Entertainment of the Earl of
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> in acknowledgment of
the King's Kindneſs and Affection
expreſs'd to him, when in <hi>England,</hi>
he built, and gave to the King, two
very ſtout Galleys, for a guard of the
Coaſt about <hi>Tangier,</hi> which were of
great importance to his Service in
thoſe parts. But altho' the King was
well pleaſed with this Princes viſit,
yet he ſhortly after received a more
welcome one from his Siſter, the
Dutcheſs of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who came to
<hi>Dover,</hi> to pay him her laſt Viſit,
and was there entertained by him
with as much Affection and Bounty,
as the time of her ſtay (which was
but ſhort) would permit. Nor was
her ſtay in this World much longer;
for ſoon after her return, ſhe
died ſuddenly, to his unexpreſſible
grief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:57792:213"/>
The King being now at peace at
home, employed his Naval Forces
againſt the <hi>Algerines,</hi> a People that
never keep Peace longer than till they
can have an opportunity to break
it: and they having taken ſome of our
Merchants Ships, Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi>
was ſent to revenge the Injury, who
coming before the Town, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
a Treaty, offering to make
reſtitution of what Money they had
taken from an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, bound
for the <hi>East-Indies;</hi> but not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſome other Demands, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to beat them into a comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and having ſeized a Barque,
loaden with Corn, and a Brigantine,
which rowed in the Harbour, in
view of the Town, departed to
<hi>Tripoly;</hi> the Baſſa of which place,
ſent him an aſſurance of his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and reſolution to preſerve a
Peace, and continue a good Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
with his Maſter: And the
<hi>Hampſhire, Portſmouth, Jerſey,</hi> and
<hi>Centurion</hi> Frigots, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Captain <hi>Beach,</hi> not long
after meeting with Seven of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines,</hi>
notwithſtanding the leaſt of
them had Thirty eight Guns, and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:57792:214"/>
were all full of Men, forced them to
run their Ships on ſhore, which
were all burned, two by themſelves,
and the reſt by the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> in which
Action moſt of their Men were loſt,
and Two hundred and fifty Chriſtian
Captives redeemed. But Sir <hi>Thomas
Allen,</hi> after having made many At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
upon thoſe Pyrates, whoſe
Cowardize ſtill ſhun the Fight, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
home, and left Sir <hi>Edward
Spragg</hi> to Command in his room;
who meeting with Nine of their Men
of War, and three Merchantmen, near
<hi>Bugia,</hi> they retired, upon his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
under the ſhelter of the Caſtle,
and put themſelves into the beſt poſture
of defence; but <hi>Spragg</hi> in the mean
time attacked them with ſo much Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and Succeſs, that he ſet moſt of
them on fire; and thoſe which eſcaped
the flame, fell into his hands, and were
made Prizes of: And to compleat the
Victory, Captain <hi>Beach</hi> brought him
another Ship, which he had newly
taken, of Forty Guns, and Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty men. So that <hi>Spragg</hi>
believing that this Loſs might diſpoſe
the <hi>Algerines</hi> to accept of Terms of
Peace, made a ſpeedy return to his
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:57792:214"/>
ſtation, before that Port; whereupon,
conſtrained by neceſſity, they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Peace, as honourable and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
as any we ever had with thoſe
Rovers.</p>
               <p>About this time a ſtrange and odd
kind of Action happened, which for
its unuſualneſs, was the matter of
much wonder and diſcourſe: For one
<hi>Thomas Bloud,</hi> commonly called Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Bloud,</hi> being diſcontented, upon
pretence of an Eſtate, detained from
him in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and having a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
with five perſons in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
armed and mounted, ſeized the
Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> as he was going
home, between St. <hi>James</hi>'s and <hi>Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>-houſe,
forcing him out of his
Coach, and attempting to have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him away, had he not been
reſcued by others coming in to his
aſſiſtance, (a Fact which rendred him
not more bold in the undertaking, than
the Duke memorable in forgiving:)
But not being able to carry off the
Duke, he next adventured to attempt
the Crown; In order whereunto, he
coming to the Keeper of the Jewel-houſe,
and deſiring to ſee the Crown
and Jewels; which being ſhewed him,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:57792:215"/>
he gratified the Keeper more liberally
than it was uſual for others to do in
ſuch caſes; telling him, that he had
ſome Friends who were very deſirous to
ſee them, and that he would bring
them the next Morning. Accordingly
he came with three others with him;
and the old Gentleman, being prepared
by <hi>Bloud</hi>'s liberality, gave them a
ready admittance into the Jewel-houſe;
but their deſign being to take, and
not to ſee, they gagg'd and ſecured
the Keeper; and then putting the
Crown and Ball into two Baggs, which
they brought with them for that
purpoſe, fairly walked away, and had
certainly carried them off, (having
paſs'd moſt of the Centinels with
them) had not the Keeper's Son-in-law
accidentally came by, and ſeeing the
condition his Father lay in, run out
haſtily, and cryed to the Guards, to
ſtop them. Whereupon fear making
them to mend their pace, they became
the means of their own diſcovery;
and being thereupon ſuſpected, and
commanded to ſtand, they fired a
Piſtol at the Centinel; but others
coming in to his aſſiſtance, two of
them were ſeized, and carried to
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:57792:215"/>
                  <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and after examination,
ſent Priſoners to the Tower, where
they had committed that bold At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
               <p>The King now finding himſelf at
leiſure, reſolved to look after the
condition of his Weſtern Sea-port
Towns, and ſpend the Summer in a
kind of Sea-Progreſs; For going
firſt to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> he went in his
Yacht to the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and
took a view of moſt of the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Ports in that Iſland; from
whence he returned to <hi>Hurſt</hi>-Caſtle,
and from thence to <hi>Corfe</hi>-Caſtle, and
having viewed, and taken order for
the furniſhing thoſe places with all
neceſſary Proviſions, returned again
to <hi>Portſmouth;</hi> and from thence,
attended with five Frigots, ſailed
to <hi>Dartmouth, Plymouth,</hi> and other
places in thoſe parts, knowing that
according to the ancient Proverb, the
Maſter's eye quickens the Servant's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the many Loſſes
ſuſtained by the <hi>Dutch</hi> in their former
War with <hi>England,</hi> and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
they met withal in attaining
a Peace, yet they took no care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:57792:216"/>
it, but by new Affronts laid
a foundation for a ſecond War; and
therefore the King having long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
his juſt Diſpleaſure againſt
them, reſolved now to let them
know his ill Reſentments of their
unworthy Dealings towards him;
Purſuant to which he declared in the
following Spring, That ſeeing his
Neighbours were making great Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
both by Sea and Land, He
thought himſelf obliged to appear
in ſuch a poſture as might beſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
his own Government, and his
Peoples peace; to make ſuch Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as ſhould be anſwerable to the
preſervation of both, which could not
be done, without fitting out a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Fleet againſt the approaching
Spring; In order whereunto, Money
being at that time wanting, he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to put a ſtop to the payment of any
Money then brought in, or to be brought
into the Exchequer, for the ſpace of one
whole Year, declaring that nothing
could have moved him thereunto, but
the looking upon his Government as
unſafe, under the threatening Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of the <hi>States General,</hi> and other
neighbouring Princes, without appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:57792:216"/>
in the ſame poſture: And that
therefore ſeeing the neceſſity was inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
ſome extraordinary courſe muſt
be taken, until Money could be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
procured.</p>
               <p>However, before he would enter
into War with them, he endeavoured
to bring them to terms of Peace by the
threatning of it; and therefore ordered
Sir <hi>George Downing,</hi> who was his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
to the States, to be very ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
with them on the Affair of the
Flagg: which, notwithſtanding it had
ever been accounted a Ceremony due
to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> as an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of their Sovereignty in the
narrow Seas, had been for ſome time
denied by them. But having, by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Inſtances and Memorials, preſſed
for an Anſwer to his Demands; and
finding nothing but delays, and ſeveral
perſonal affronts to him, he returned,
without Orders, for <hi>England,</hi> and was,
for ſo doing, after a private Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by ſome Lords of the Council, and
Report thereof made to the King, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the <hi>Tower</hi> for not obſerving
the Orders ſent him. At which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the States, the King being
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſtly enraged, reſolved to trifle with
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:57792:217"/>
them no longer, but make them feel
the effects of his Indignation. And
knowing that whilſt he had Wars
abroad, it was neceſſary to have Peace
and Union at home, he put forth a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of Indulgence to all Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Perſons, promiſing, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Indulgence, to maintain the
Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> as it was then eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Robert Holmes</hi> Cruiſing with five
of the King's Frigots near the Iſle of
<hi>Wight,</hi> about the middle of <hi>March</hi> met
with the <hi>Dutch Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Streight</hi>
Fleet, Convoyed by ſix of their men of
War, and ſtanding with them, gave
them a Gun to ſtrike and lower their
Flag; which they refuſing, he poured
a Broad-ſide upon them: whereupon,
their Convoy coming up, the Fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
about two in the afternoon, and
continued until night, and the next
morning was again renewed, five of
their richeſt Merchant-men being taken,
their Reer-Admiral ſunk, and the reſt
made their eſcape for want of more
aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The firſt blow being thus given, the
King denounced open War againſt
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:57792:217"/>
them, by Publiſhing his Declaration,
wherein he gave the World an account
of the Grounds and Reaſons of his
Quarrel with them; which, together
with the <hi>French</hi> Kings preparations and
proceedings towards them, in laying
great Impoſitions upon their Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
which they foreſaw tended to a
rupture with them, they fortifiing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with all imaginable ſpeed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
endeavoured to procure Allies
abroad, and made the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
their Captain-General at Land, and
Admiral at Sea: And looking upon <hi>Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht,</hi>
as the firſt place that would in
all probability be attacked by the
<hi>French</hi> King, they repaired the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
thereof, and re-inforced that
City with Men and Proviſions.</p>
               <p>The King reſolving to proſecute the
War with all imaginable reſolution
and vigour, provided for the ſecurity
of his own Subjects, by allowing them
ſufficient Convoys, and giving them
liberty to make uſe of what Foreign
Mariners they could procure. And his
Fleet being now ready to put to Sea, he
went to <hi>Rye</hi> to ſee them joyn with a
Squadron of <hi>French</hi> Ships, which that
King, according to agreement, was to
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:57792:218"/>
furniſh him with, under the Command
of the Count <hi>d' Eſtree,</hi> Vice-Admiral
of <hi>France.</hi> And ſo ſoon as he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
the two Fleets being now joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſtood over for the Coaſt of <hi>Holland,</hi>
Commanded by His preſent Majeſty,
then Duke of <hi>York,</hi> whoſe very name
was terrible to the <hi>Dutch.</hi> And on the
twenty eighth of <hi>May</hi> meeting with
the Enemies Fleet, about five Leagues
off the <hi>Wheelings,</hi> there enſued a very
fierce and bloody Engagement, both
ſides being emulous for Honour, and
deſirous of Victory, fighting with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
eagerneſs: But the night
coming on, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unable to bear up againſt the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſtood towards their
own Coaſts, and were purſued by the
Duke, who reſolved to have renewed
the Engagement the next morning,
had not a Fog prevented, and favoured
their ſecuring themſelves in their Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
The loſs on the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſide was
very great, both as to Men and Ships,
but on the part of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> there
was little Dammage, beſide the loſs of
the Earl of <hi>Sandwich</hi> and the Royal
<hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:57792:218"/>
This loſs at Sea was attended with
many more on Land, the <hi>French</hi> King
having taken ſeveral of their Frontier
Towns, which poſſeſſed them with ſuch
a Conſternation, that many of the
wealthy Inhabitants forſook their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations,
reſolving not to hazard their
Perſons and Eſtates in a Countrey fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into the hands of a Victorious Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner;
And the States not thinking
themſelves ſecure enough at the <hi>Hague,</hi>
removed to <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> and to impede
the <hi>French</hi> King's approach, cauſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the
Sluces to be opened, and the Country
be put under Water, to the incredible
Prejudice and Dammage of the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Inhabitants. Which Diſtraction of
theirs, the King of <hi>England</hi> wiſely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
to the ſtrengthening himſelf
and the weakening of them, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth a ſeaſonable Declaration;
wherein he promiſed, <q>That if any of
their Subjects, out of affection to him
or his Government, or to avoid the
oppreſſion they met with at home,
would take refuge in his Kingdom,
they ſhould be protected in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and Eſtates, and have an Act paſs
for their Naturalization, and that
ſuch Ships as they brought with
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:57792:219"/>
them ſhould be accounted as <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Built, and enjoy the ſame Priviledges
and Immunities, as to Trade, Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and Cuſtoms, as thoſe of his
own Subjects.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, commiſerating the deplorable
condition into which the <hi>States</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and ſuppoſing their misfortunes
had rendred them more humble, he ſent
the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the Earl
of <hi>Arlington,</hi> to try if they would at
length offer any reaſonable terms of
Peace; who were received, by the
Common People, with great joy and
ſatisfaction, crying out, God bleſs the
King of <hi>England,</hi> and God bleſs the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> but the Devil take
the <hi>States.</hi> But their Pride being not
ſufficiently abated, the Embaſſadors
returned without bringing them to any
Concluſion; which, together with the
<hi>French</hi> King's taking <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleets appearing upon their
Coaſts, ſo enraged the People, that
they brake out into tumultuous Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections:
and there was ſcarce a Town
in <hi>Holland,</hi> where they were not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterleſs.
And therefore the <hi>States,</hi> that
they might appeaſe them, commanded
their Fleet to go out and beat the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:57792:219"/>
from their Harbours; which <hi>De Ruyter</hi>
attempted with all the force that Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Reſolution could inſpire him
with: but finding himſelf overmatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
was forced to retire with conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
loſs. The Fleets having both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
the Dammages of this Fight,
haſtened to try their fortune in a ſecond
Engagement: which being as unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful
to the <hi>Dutch</hi> as the former,
<hi>De Ruyter</hi> ſtole away in the night:
But having increaſed his Fleet, was
not long before he got to Sea again,
and meeting about the middle of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi>
with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to get the Wind of them, which
then blew <hi>North-Eaſt,</hi> reſolving, if
poſſible, to redeem his loſt reputation:
but night coming on, both Fleets came
to an Anchor. The next day., the
Fight began with the morning; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſuſtained a very great
loſs, and the greateſt part of their Fleet
had in all probability been deſtroy'd,
and the conteſt about the Dominion of
the Narrow-Seas ended, had not the
Cowardly <hi>French,</hi> who were then Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Wind, behaved themſelves
as though they had been ſent thither
only to be ſpectators of the Bravery and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:57792:220"/>
Valour of the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Whereupon, the
<hi>States-General,</hi> finding they could no
longer withſtand the ſucceſsful Arms
of that fortunate King, ſued for Peace
by their Embaſſador, and had it gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as well out of Pity to them, as Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
of the <hi>French</hi> King's too growing
greatneſs, whoſe Progreſs they were
now at leiſure to oppoſe.</p>
               <p>The King having now conſented to
admit the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to terms of Peace,
became a Mediator for the like ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
between the Crown of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> endeavouring by his
Embaſſador, the Lord <hi>Lockhart,</hi> to
compoſe the differences between them;
and reſolving, whether he ſucceeded
in that Mediation or not, to be no parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
with them in their Quarrels: and
Commanded, by Proclamation, that
none of his Subjects ſhould enter into
the Service of any Foreign Prince.
And for the better ſecuring of Trade
to and from his Ports (which was
much diſturbed by the Inſolency of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Dutch, Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers,
betwixt whom the War ſtill
continued) he Publiſh'd a Proclamation,
wherein he declared, That all Ships,
to what Party ſoever they belonged,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:57792:220"/>
ſhould be under his Protection, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their ſtay in any of his Ports or
Harbours; Commanding the Officers
of his Navy, to uſe their utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
to hinder the Roving of any
Private Men ſo near his Coaſt, as
to give apprehenſion of danger to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.
And that if a Man of War,
of either Party, and one or more Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-Men
of another, ſhould come
into any of his Ports, the Merchant-Men
ſhould ſail out two Tides before
the Man of War ſhould be permitted
to ſtirr; forbidding his Sea-men to Liſt
themſelves on Board any Foreign Man
of War, or other Ship deſigned for
Traffick, or the Fiſhing-Trade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Licence: laying down ſeveral
other Rules in Relation to the ſecurity
of Trade, and the Maintaining his
Sovereignty in thoſe Seas, which were
punctually obſerved, and thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Merchants and Traders preſerved
from being made prize of by their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
And that he might ſecure the
Peace of his Kingdom for the future, as
well as for the preſent, he procured
the Parliament to give him the ſum of
five hundred eighty four thouſand nine
hundred and ſeventy eight Pounds, for
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:57792:221"/>
the ſpeedy building thirty Ships of
War, which he cauſed to be built ſo
large and ſubſtantial, that they coſt him
one hundred thouſand Pounds more
than they gave him.</p>
               <p>And now beginning to reflect upon
the ſucceſs of the <hi>French</hi> King's Arms;
and fearing leſt the growing Greatneſs
of that Monarch might too much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
his own Glory, and threaten the
future Peace of his Kingdom, reſolved
with himſelf, by entring into an Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with ſome Princes and States
abroad, to put a ſtop to his further
Conqueſts in <hi>Flanders:</hi> And that the
<hi>French</hi> might not think him in jeſt only,
he immediately applied himſelf to the
raiſing of Forces, and in a ſhort time
had a brave Army on Foot, ready to
be tranſported into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
his Niece, the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> (eldeſt
Daughter to his only Brother the Duke
of <hi>York)</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parliament having, at their laſt
ſitting, deſired him to haſten his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
into ſuch Councils and Alliances
as might ſave what remained of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
from being devoured by the <hi>French;</hi>
he acquainted them, at their next
Meeting, with what he had done,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:57792:221"/>
telling them, that he had made ſuch
an agreement with <hi>Holland,</hi> and the
reſt of the Confederates, that if ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
by plentiful ſupplies from them,
and due care from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for
their own Preſervation, he doubted not
but to reſtore ſuch an Honourable Peace
to Chriſtendom, as might not be in
the Power of one Prince alone to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb,
which he had endeavoured by a
fair Treaty: And was reſolved, if that
ſucceeded not, to enter into an actual
War with <hi>France,</hi> laying before them
the expences he had been at already,
and what ſums of Money ſuch a War
would neceſſarily require. And to
remove all ſorts of Jealouſies, he had
Married his Niece to the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> thereby giving full aſſurance,
never to ſuffer that Prince's Intereſt to
be ruined, if aſſiſted by them as he ought
to be to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>To Alarm the <hi>French</hi> King the
more with a noiſe of War, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
made ſeveral Addreſſes to the
King; wherein they intreated him to
enter into an Actual War with that
Crown, promiſing to ſtand by him
with their Lives and Fortunes to that
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:57792:222"/>
end: And a Book was Publiſhed, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,
<hi>Chriſtianiſſimus Chriſtianandus,</hi>
wherein reaſons were given for redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the moſt Chriſtian King to a more
Chriſtian ſtate in <hi>Europe.</hi> And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the <hi>French</hi> King ſtill went on
in his Conqueſts, he ſent ſome Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his new raiſed Forces over
into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to ſecure the places of
greateſt conſequence there, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a Faſt, on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the tenth
of <hi>April,</hi> to be kept in <hi>London,</hi> and on
that day fortnight throughout the
whole Kingdom, to implore the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
of Heaven on his undertakings.
And the Parliament to aſſiſt him with
Money, which is the ſinews of War,
raiſed him a liberal ſum by a Pole-Bill;
and that they might weaken the <hi>French</hi>
as well as ſtrengthen him, Prohibited
<hi>French</hi> Wines, and other things of
the Growth and Manufactury of that
Country, a contrivance that would
certainly have reduced him to terms
of Moderation and Peace, had the reſt
of the Confederates done the like, but
for want of that, the deſign of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
fell, and he received little or
no dammage thereby. However, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:57792:222"/>
how fatal the Arms of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
had formerly been to <hi>France;</hi> and
being Thunder-ſtrook with the Fame
of the King's having in forty days rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
an Army of thirty thouſand Men,
and fitted out a Navy of ninety Ships,
he durſt not adventure (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſucceſs in <hi>Flanders)</hi> to run the
hazard of a War with that Nation.
To prevent which, he reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to a Peace with ſome of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates,
hoping thereby to break the
meaſures already taken by King <hi>Charles,</hi>
and therefore preſently offered a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Treaty with <hi>Holland;</hi> which Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
according to their uſual (though
unjuſt and baſe Cuſtom, of ſerving
themſelves and leaving their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
in the lurch) without acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the King of <hi>England</hi> therewith,
accepted of, and afterwards concluded,
upon condition that he would give up
<hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> and other places which he
had taken from them during the War.
But beſides their uſual cuſtom of wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the firſt opportunity of ſlipping
their own necks out of the Coller,
they being informed, that the League
Offenſive and Defenſive, which the
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:57792:223"/>
King of <hi>England</hi> had entred into
with them, was not well underſtood
at home, and had met with ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting
and very undeſerv'd Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and that the Parliament had
taken up a Reſolution of giving no
Money, till ſatisfaction was firſt had
in ſome Matters of Religion, and
thoſe Jealouſies removed, which they
had without all ground taken up of
his Proceedings, very much influenced
their entrance into that Treaty; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding,
that it was now vain to
rely any longer upon <hi>England,</hi> ſince
<hi>England</hi> was no longer it ſelf, by
reaſon of thoſe Diviſions and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings
between the King and
his Parliament.</p>
               <p>But the King, who was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of what the <hi>Dutch</hi> were doing,
reſolving to ſave <hi>Flanders</hi> either by
a War or Peace, perſwaded the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the reſt of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
to accept of the ſame Treaty
with them, endeavouring to procure
a Ceſſation of Arms on all ſides, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of the Treaty, the better
to make way for the deſired Peace.
However, conſidering the influence that
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:57792:223"/>
Peace would have upon <hi>England,</hi> was
altogether uncertain, and knowing
that by his late Preparations and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances,
he had provoked a mighty
and a warlike King, he thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to provide for his own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
if the worſt ſhould happen, by
keeping up his Army, and continuing
his Fleet at Sea; eſpecially ſince that
was the moſt probable means to make
the <hi>French</hi> King account it his intereſt
to haſten the Peace, and procure to
himſelf the more advantagious Terms
therein, telling his Parliament, which
met ſoon after, That although they
would peradventure account the Peace
he was endeavouring to procure, as
ill a bargain as War, becauſe it coſt
them Money; yet if they ſeriouſly
conſidered, that <hi>Flanders</hi> might have,
perhaps, been loſt by that time, he
believed, they would give much
greater Sums than all the Charge he
he had been at, amounted to, rather
than the ſingle Town of <hi>Oſtend</hi> ſhould
be in the <hi>French</hi> King's hands, and
Forty or Fifty of his Ships of War
in ſo good a Haven, over againſt the
Rivers mouth: adding, That he
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:57792:224"/>
could not but be very well pleaſed, to
underſtand the Reputation he had
gained abroad, by having in ſo ſhort
a time rais'd ſo great an Army, and
fitted out ſo brave a Fleet; and
hoped that they were ſo too, ſince
it ſo much redounded to the Honour
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, deſiring them
therefore, if they had any reſpect
to their own Welfare, and the Peace
of <hi>Europe,</hi> or were willing he ſhould
paſs any part of his Life in quiet, and
all the reſt in confidence and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with them and other future
Parliaments, to take care for the
maintaining Peace and Union at home,
and the ſetling the ſame Revenue he
had the <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> before, (ſome of it
being then fallen off) upon him for
Life, and add 300000 <hi>l. per Annum</hi>
thereunto, to enable him to maintain
the Navy and Ord'nance, and keep
his Word with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
in the payment of 40000 <hi>l.</hi> as his
Nieces Portion; the firſt Payment
whereof was then become due, and
demanded by that Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="369" facs="tcp:57792:224"/>
But the <hi>French</hi> King, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Ceſſation of Arms, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to enlarge his Conqueſts, and
poſſeſs himſelf of ſeveral conſiderable
Towns, he reſolved to prevent him;
and therefore commanded the Duke
of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who was at that time
General of all his Land Forces, and
the Earl of <hi>Oſſery</hi> to joyn the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> and attempt the beating
of him from the Siege of <hi>Mons,</hi>
which was then very much ſtraitned
by him, and would in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
have been loſt within a few days:
The <hi>French,</hi> who lay encamp'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Woods, the right Wing
poſted at St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> and their left at
<hi>Mamoy St. Pierre,</hi> with ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that beſides the Woods, there
was only a Precipice led to them,
which made them almoſt inacceſſable,
thought themſelves ſecure; but the
Cannon playing briskly upon St. <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
and the valiant <hi>Engliſh,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Earl of <hi>Oſſery,</hi> fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing
on with their accuſtomed Courage
and Fury, ſoon forced the Abbey,
and compell'd the <hi>French,</hi> poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there, to fly in great diſorder
to their main body, many of them
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:57792:225"/>
being ſlain in the diſpute, which
was very hot: And the Duke of
<hi>Luxenburgh,</hi> who was Commander
there, as the <hi>French</hi> King's General,
notwithſtanding he had upon their
firſt approach, (on a preſumption that
he lay encamp'd in a place which was
impregnable) laught at, and derided
the vain Attempt, as he imagined, of
forcing his Camp; finding he had now
to do with the reſolute <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
not the timerous <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or wary
<hi>Germans,</hi> diſlodg'd in great confuſion,
leaving his ſlain and many wounded
Men behind, and the Tents ſtanding as
they were, to the Plunder of his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Enemies; whereby the relieving
of <hi>Mons,</hi> a work thought little leſs then
impoſſible, was eaſily performed, and
the <hi>French</hi> King diſappointed of his
hopes: And had that ſucceeſs been
followed and improv'd, the <hi>French</hi>
King would in all probability have been
reduced to great extremities, and have
been glad to have accepted of Peace
upon any Conditions he could have
gotten; but the Peace which he had,
upon the march of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> haſtily
concluded a few days before at <hi>Neme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen,</hi>
put a ſtop to all farther hoſtilities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:57792:225"/>
Things being brought to this happy
concluſion abroad, new Stirs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
begin to appear at home; For
one <hi>Titus Oates,</hi> who had receiv'd Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
&amp; Orders in the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
and was afterward (ſeemingly, or God
knows how) reconcil'd to the <hi>Church of
Rome,</hi> going firſt into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and then
into <hi>Spain,</hi> ingratiated himſelf with the
Jeſuits and Prieſts in thoſe parts, with
a deſign, as he afterward pretended, to
diſcover what they were plotting againſt
<hi>England,</hi> returning about this time,
inform'd the King of a Plot, carried on
by the Jeſuits, and others of the <hi>Roman
Catholick Religion,</hi> againſt his Perſon
and Life, the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and
the Government of the Kingdom; And
that his Information might appear the
more plauſible, and be the more readily
believed, he named divers Perſons of
Quality engaged in the Deſign, and what
Inſtruments had been provided for his
Aſſaſſination; affirming, that when he
was once taken off, the remaining part
of the Work, was to have been carried
on by Arms, Foreign Aſſiſtance, and
ſuch other Expedients as they ſhould
have judged neceſſary for the ſucceſs of
their Enterpriſe. Whether there was
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:57792:226"/>
any truth at all in this Relation, or how
much there was, or whether the King
at all believed it, is none of my buſineſs
to determine, ſince I deſign as an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian,
only to relate matter of Fact;
but certain it is, that many Troubles
and Combuſtions were occaſioned
thereby, and ſeveral great and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Miſchiefs have ſince fallen ſo thick
upon theſe Kingdoms, that one hath
ever trod upon the heels of another.</p>
               <p>Upon this Information the Privy-Councel
ſate twice a day, to conſider
and examin that Plot, and Sir <hi>George
Wakeman,</hi> one of the Queen's Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> the Dutcheſs of
<hi>York</hi>'s Secretary, Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> of the
<hi>Temple,</hi> and ſeveral others were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
cloſe Priſoners; and the Lords
<hi>Bellaſſis, Powis, Peters, Arundel</hi> of <hi>Warder,
Caſtlemain,</hi> and <hi>Stafford,</hi> were ſecured in
the <hi>Tower.</hi> And the Parliament ſitting
ſoon after, the King told them in his
Speech, That he had been informed of
a Deſign againſt his Perſon, carried on
by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> whereof he ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to give his opinion, leſt he ſhould
ſeem to ſay too much, or too little, but
would leave the matter wholly to the
deciſion of the Law, without prejudging
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:57792:226"/>
the perſons accuſed: But the ſtrict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into that Matter having diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many unwarrantable Practices of
theirs, he thought he had reaſon to
look to 'em. Altho' this Plot, in all the
parts of it, was a complication of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,
yet the greateſt myſtery of all
ſeems to be the buſineſs of Sir <hi>Edmond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
Godfrey,</hi> who being a Juſtice of the
Peace for <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and a ſevere ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as was generally
ſuppoſed, took the Depoſitions of <hi>Oates</hi>
and <hi>Tongue,</hi> and was ſoon after found
dead in a Ditch, not far from <hi>Hampſted,</hi>
with his Sword run through him, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to the Coroners Inqueſt, to
have been firſt ſtrangled, before he was
brought thither; which was ſworn by
<hi>Bedloe,</hi> who came in upon the King's
offer, in his Proclamation, of 500 <hi>l.</hi> to
any that would diſcover the manner of
his death; and <hi>Prance,</hi> who was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by him, as he was attending in
the Lobby of the Lords Houſe, to be
done by the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The examination of this Plot, and the
Murder of <hi>Godfrey,</hi> which they look'd
upon as a ſufficient confirmation of its
truth and reality, employed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
ſo aſſiduouſly, that they ſat whole
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:57792:227"/>
days to conſult about it, without ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from Morning till it was late at
Night; the product whereof was, a
Faſt enjoined by Proclamation, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Nation; the Minutes of that
Houſe, forbid to be divulged; a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
entred by them in their Journal,
That it was their Opinion, upon the
Evidence that had already appeared to
that Houſe, there had been and was an
execrable and helliſh Deſign, contrived
and carried on by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> for aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
the King, ſubverting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and deſtroying the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
Religion; a Proclamation, which ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
all the reputed <hi>Papiſts</hi> ten Miles
from <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> except
Houſholders, who were obliged like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to take the Oaths, or ſuffer the
Penalties inflicted by Law upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſers
of them; and another for the
turning all <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> out of the
Horſe and Foot-Guards, wherein 20 <hi>l.</hi>
was promiſed to thoſe who ſhould
diſcover any Officer or Soldier who had
formerly taken the Oaths and Teſt, and
had ſince turned <hi>Papist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Commons not yet ſatisfied,
it was moved in that Houſe, That an
Addreſs ſhould be made to the King,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:57792:227"/>
to remove the Duke of <hi>York</hi> from his
Preſence and Councels, but he being
informed of their intention, reſolved to
prevent them, and endeavour to take
them off from their unſeaſonable heat,
by aſſuring them of his ſtedfaſt Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to defend them in their juſt Rights
and Priviledges, and comply with any
reaſonable offer they ſhould make for
the ſecurity of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion;</hi>
in order whereunto, he went the next
day in his Robes to the Houſe of Peers,
and having commanded the Commons
to attend him, in a Speech to both
Houſes, he gave them his hearty
thanks for their extraordinary care, for
the preſervation of his Life in that time
of danger; telling them, that he was
as ready to joyn with them in all ways
and means that might conduce to the
eſtabliſhment and ſecurity of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion,</hi> as their own hearts
could wiſh, and that not only during
his Life, but in future Ages, even to the
end of the World; and therefore was
come thither at that time, to aſſure them
that whatſoever reaſonable Bills they
ſhould at any time preſent to him, to
be paſs'd into Laws, for the rendring
them ſafe in the Reign of his Succeſſor,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:57792:228"/>
ſo as they tended not to impeach the
Right of Succeſſion, nor the Deſcent of
the Crown in the true Line, and ſo alſo
as they did not reſtrain and limit the
juſt Rights and Power of the Throne,
ſhould find from him a ready concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
And to demonſtrate his reality
therein, when he had about the latter
end of that Month a Bill preſented to
him, for the diſſabling all <hi>Popiſh</hi> Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
to ſit in either Houſe of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he gave his Royal Aſſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
tho' at the ſame time he refuſed
another, which was for raiſing a third
part of the Militia to be in conſtant
Arms for a time; telling them, that that
were to put the Militia out of his own
power, which thing he would not do,
no not for one hour; but promiſed, if
they would aſſiſt him with Money for
that purpoſe, to raiſe ſuch a part of the
Militia, as ſhould ſecure the Peace of
the Government and his own Perſon.</p>
               <p>And now ſeveral of thoſe accuſed by
<hi>Oates,</hi> and others, (for the Witneſſes
were by this time increaſed) were
brought to Tryal before Sir <hi>William
Scroggs,</hi> then Lord Chief Juſtice of the
<hi>Kings bench;</hi> And thoſe that gave evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
againſt them, being very poſitive
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:57792:228"/>
in their Depoſitions, <hi>Coleman, Ireland,
Pickering, Groves, Whitebread, Fenwick,
Langhorn,</hi> and divers more, were at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times condemned and executed;
and ſo was <hi>William Staley,</hi> a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith's
Son in <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dangerous words againſt the King's
Life; and three more, whoſe Names
were <hi>Green, Berry,</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> upon the
evidence of <hi>Bedloe</hi> and <hi>Prance,</hi> for the
Murder of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,
Prance</hi> affirming, he was murdred in
<hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> and that himſelf aſſiſted
in the murdring of him: They every
one died, denying what they were
charged withal, and aſſerting their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
with all the Solemn Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
imaginable, which was credited,
or disbelieved, according to peoples va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
inclinations. And now ſome Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Parliament began to accuſe each
other; Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> who had been a
little before Embaſſador to the <hi>French</hi>
King, carried up five Articles againſt
the Treaſurer <hi>Danby;</hi> and Sir <hi>John Ern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
another of the Commons, accuſed
<hi>Mountague,</hi> of holding a correſpondency
with the Popes Nuncio at <hi>Paris,</hi> but for
his good ſervice, in accuſing <hi>Danby,</hi> that
was overlook'd, and a reſolution taken to
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:57792:229"/>
proceed with ſeverity againſt the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer.</p>
               <p>This Parliament, which firſt began
on the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> in the year 1661. and
had now been continued, by ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations
and Adjournments, for 17
Years, 8 Months, and 17 Days, began to
grow ſo preſumptuous, that upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
that Sir <hi>Joſeph William<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
then Secretary of State, had
counter-ſigned ſeveral Commiſſions for
Officers, who were <hi>Roman</hi> Recuſants,
with a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> to the Oaths and
Teſt, they took the boldneſs to commit
him priſoner to the Tower; whereupon
the King commanding them the next
day to attend him in the Banquetting-houſe,
briskly told them, That tho'
they had committed his Servant, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
acquainting him, yet he would deal
more freely with them, in acquainting
them with his intentions to releaſe his
Secretary; which he immediately or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
to be done, and finding there was
but little good to be expected from their
proceedings, he prorogued them on the
<hi>30th</hi> of <hi>Decemb.</hi> and on the <hi>24th</hi> of the
following <hi>January,</hi> diſſolved them by
Proclamation, and called a new one, to
ſit on the <hi>6th</hi> of the next <hi>March,</hi> iſſuing
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:57792:229"/>
out <hi>Writs</hi> for the ſpeedy chuſing of them.</p>
               <p>From the Counſels and Debates of
this new Parliament which met at the
time appointed, the King expected more
felicity than he had met with from thoſe
of the former; and therefore to prevent
all occaſions of diſguſt, and hinder them
from falling with the like heat upon his
Brother, deſired the Duke to retire for
ſome time beyond the Seas: for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
expreſt in the following Letter.</p>

moreover, that ſince his Neighbours
were making Naval Preparations, he
thought it neceſſary ſtill to maintain a
Fleet at Sea, and that it highly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to provide a conſtant eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

his Speech, with his earneſt deſires to
have that Parliament prove a Healing

reſolution to defend with his Life
the Proteſtant Religion, and the Laws
of the Kingdom: and that he expected,

from the Calumny, as well as danger,
of thoſe worſt of Men, who endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to render both <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

               <p>The Commons, as ſoon as they were

<pb n="383" facs="tcp:57792:230"/>
Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi> for their Speaker, whom
they lookt upon as the fitteſt Perſon for

but the King refuſing to admit

to convince the World that they were
Leavened with the ſame Principles, and
reſolved to thwart the King's Deſigns
for ſetling the Nations as much as the
former had done, begun where they end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ordering a Committee to inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the manner how <hi>Danby</hi> had ſued out
his Pardon which was granted him by
the King, to ſecure the Earl, for whom
he had a particular affection, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
found him faithful to his Intereſt,
from all fear of Puniſhment for any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Crimes, ſuppoſing, as well he
might, that they would not diſpute his
Power of Pardoning, ſince it was by the
Law inveſted on him as one of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Jewels of his Crown. But finding,
upon ſearch, that the Pardon was not
entred after its paſſing at the Secretaries
Office, in any other Office, 'till it came
to the Lord Chancellor, and ſo diſpatcht
in a private manner; They Reſolve upon
an Addreſs to the King, to repreſent to

conſequence of granting Pardons

of the Commons, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Lords, that he might be ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
from their Houſe, and put into ſafe
Cuſtody: who accordingly ordered the
Uſher of the Black Rod to take him,
which he had done, had he not abſented
himſelf. Whereupon, a Bill was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be brought in, to Command his
ſurrendring himſelf by a certain day, or
in default thereof, to ſtand attainted.
And the Lords having in the mean while
paſs'd a Bill for Baniſhing and diſabling
of him, and ſent it down to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
for their concurrence, it was reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
as a Cenſure too favourable; and
a Vote paſs'd for an Addreſs to the King,
that he would not permit him to reſide

Court, A Lord Preſident, and a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of <hi>Scotland.</hi> And according
to that new Model, as many of them
as were in Court, met the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Council-Chamber, and were
ſworn Privy Councellors: The King
going the ſame day to the Parliament,
acquainted the Two Houſes with what
he had done; and aſſured them he was
reſolved in all weighty and important
Affairs, next to his great Council in
Parliament, to be adviſed by that Privy
Council. And it being his cuſtom, as
it had been his Fathers before him, to
take off ſome hot Spirits, whoſe Parts
and Abilities he judged might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
to his own and the Publicks
advantage, by promoting them to ſome
Place or Office of Truſt, or otherwiſe
winning them to his Friendſhip, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
they were ſuch whoſe Natures, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by their deſigns, had rendred
obſtinate and implacable, as the Earl
of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> afterward appeared to
be; he for the moſt part choſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:57792:232"/>
Fifteen, which were to compleat
his Council, out of their number,
and made <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> Lord Preſident of
it.</p>
               <p>The Parliament reſolving to haſten
the Trial of the Lords, <hi>Danby</hi> and
<hi>Bellaaſis,</hi> appeared in perſon at the Bar
of the Lords Houſe; where the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
put in his Plea, and the other his
Anſwer. And the next day <hi>Stafford,
Arundel</hi> and <hi>Powis,</hi> appeared there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
and having retracted their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Pleas, which appeared inſufficient
to the Commons, they put in their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Anſwers.</p>
               <p>And the King commanding the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to attend him in the Houſe of
Lords, renewed the Aſſurances he had
formerly given them, of his being ready
to aſſent to any Laws they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the ſecurity of the Proteſtant
Religion, ſo that the Deſcent of the
Crown in the Right Line, were not
thereby defeated: And that he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a proviſion ſhould be made to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
a Popiſh from a Proteſtant
Succeſſor; and limit the Authority of
the former, if any ſuch ſhould be, by
providing that all Church-preferments
ſhould be conferred on Pious and
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:57792:233"/>
Learned Proteſtants: That the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which ſhould happen to be in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at his own Death; or if none, the
laſt that ſate, ſhould thereupon aſſemble
without any new Summons or Election:
That during the Reign of any Popiſh
Succeſſor, no Privy Councellor, or
Judg of the Common Law, or Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
ſhould be put in, or diſplaced,
but by conſent of Parliament: That
none ſhould be Juſtices of Peace but
Proteſtants; and that the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants,
and Deputy Lieutenants of
Counties, and Officers in the Navy,
ſhould not be put in, nor removed, but
by the Authority of Parliament: Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them, he conceived it hard to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
any other Reſtraint to be put on
a Popiſh Succeſſor; Yet if any thing
did occur to their Wiſdom, whereby
their Religion and Liberties might be
better ſecured, he was ready to conſent
to it.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Commons, after they
had ſeveral times adjourned the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of this Speech, on the <hi>11th</hi>
of <hi>May,</hi> reſolved, That they would
ſtand by His Majeſty with their Lives
and Fortunes: And that if he ſhould
come by any violent Death, which they
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:57792:233"/>
prayed God to avert, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
it to the utmoſt upon the <hi>Papiſts;</hi>
According to which Vote an Addreſs
was drawn up, and preſented by them
to the King, with this Variation in the
form of words, <hi>We ſhall be ready to
revenge upon the Papiſts any violence
offered by them to your Sacred Majeſty;</hi>
which words were neither expreſt nor
intimated in their Vote, altho abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary and eſſential to the
Juſtice of their deſigned Revenge.</p>
               <p>And without taking the leaſt notice
of the Reſolution expreſt in his Speech,
Not to ſuffer any alteration in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
to the Throne, brought in a Bill
to diſable his Royal Highneſs to inherit
the Imperial Crown of <hi>England;</hi>
which being put to the Vote, was
carried in the Affirmative by One and
Twenty Voices; but being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued
ſoon after, it proceeded no
further.</p>
               <p>In the mean while the Two Houſes
were very earneſt in debating the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
whereby they ſhould bring the
Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> to their Trials: And
<hi>Danby</hi> being demanded at the Bar of
the Lords Houſe, Whether he would
rely on, and abide by the Plea of his
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:57792:234"/>
Pardon, returned for anſwer; That
having been adviſed by his Council,
his Pardon was good in Law, he would
inſiſt upon his Plea; and requeſted his
Council might be heard: And the Lords
acquainting the Commons with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
inſtead of granting it, they in the
Names of the Knights, Citizens, and
Burgeſſes in Parliament, and all the
Commons of <hi>England,</hi> demanded
Judgment againſt him upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment,
affirming his Pardon to be
illegal and void. However, the Lords
appointed him a day to argue his Plea,
and ordered the Five Lords to be tried
the Week after, and an Addreſs to be
made to the King for the appointing a
Lord Steward for their Trials. But
the Commons not ſatisfied with their
proceedings, deſired a Committee of
both Houſes might conſider of the moſt
proper methods of proceeding upon
Impeachments, according to the uſage
of Parliament; but the Lords refuſed
it, as contrary to the known Rules and
Orders of their Houſe, which ever was,
and ought to be tender in matters rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to their Judicature. Whereupon
the Commons reſolved, That no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner
ſhould preſume to maintain the
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:57792:234"/>
Validity of the Pardon pleaded by
<hi>Danby,</hi> without the leave of that
Houſe: And that the perſons ſo doing,
ſhould be accounted Betrayers of the
Liberties of the Commons of <hi>England.</hi>
Upon which the Lords, to take away all
occaſion of diſguſt between the Two
Houſes, receded from their former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
and appointed a Committee to
treat with them: but a difference ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in that joynt Committee, about
the Biſhops Right to be preſent at Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
in capital caſes; the Lords affirming,
they might ſtay till the Court pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to the Vote of <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>Not
Guilty;</hi> and the Commons denying it,
the Biſhops endeavour'd to find out a
<hi>Medium</hi> which might ſatisfie both; and
therefore deſired leave of the Lords to
withdraw themſelves from the Trials,
with liberty of entring their uſual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations.
But this not ſatisfying the
Commons, they reſolved not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the Trial of the Five Lords,
before Judgment given on <hi>Danby</hi>'s
Pardon; and to inſiſt upon the Biſhops
having no Right of Voting in capital
Offences; which made the King, who
ſaw that theſe heats took up their whole
time, and prevented their entring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:57792:235"/>
ſuch Debates as more nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
them, and would have condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
more toward the ſetling of the
Nation, thought it beſt to prorogue
them, in hopes that in their next meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Debates might be more happy
and unanimous.</p>
               <p>About this time the Faction ran
higher in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and boiled into an

by which all the Mock-Laws made in
the late Anarchy, were repealed:
And publiſht an inſolent Declaration,
full of Treaſon, and ſtuft with the
very Spirit and Quinteſcence of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
inviting others to joyn with them;
which the Covenanters (commonly
there called <hi>WHIGS;</hi> from whence
the Name was afterward brought into
<hi>England,</hi> and applied to all the Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Party) accepted of, and flockt ſo
faſt to them, that their Army increaſed
daily to ſuch a conſiderable number,
that they became formidable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the King haſtned away the Duke
of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> as his <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> to
ſuppreſs them; which with the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Loyal Gentry and Herri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of that Nation, he eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in one Battel at <hi>Bothwell-Bridg:</hi>
For having forced his paſſage over the
Bridg, and ſeized the only piece of
Cannon they had, they fled toward
<hi>Hamilton-Park:</hi> And altho they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
rallied again, and Faced about,
upon the advantage of a riſing ground,
yet ſo ſoon as the Cannon began to
play on them, they all fled in diſorder
and confuſion; <hi>Robert Hamilton,</hi> who
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:57792:236"/>
was their chief Commander, being one
of the firſt. There were many of the
Rebels kill'd in the place, and ſeveral
hundreds taken Priſoners, whereof
ſome few were Executed.</p>
               <p>The King, who was willing to try all
means to pleaſe and ſatisfie his people,
fearing the Animoſities of that Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
were too great to admit of a
Reconciliation, and would prevent
their doing any thing which would
tend to his, or the Kingdoms benefit,
on the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> diſſolved it by
Proclamation, and declared his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to call a new one, which ſhould
ſit on the <hi>17th</hi> of the following <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while Sir <hi>George Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>

abated, the Jury brought them in
<hi>Not Guilty;</hi> and <hi>Wakeman</hi> was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
diſcharged from his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

been, had they not in their Defence

               <p>
                  <hi>Wakeman</hi>'s being thus acquitted,
ſtartled the Mobille, who expected all
that were accuſed of that Plot, ſhould
have been condemned of courſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſpect to the Truth or Falſhood
of the Accuſation. And the Faction
endeavoured to improve their diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
into Rage and Sedition, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſcurrilous Libels, wherein they
accuſe <hi>Scroggs</hi> of perverting Juſtice,
and taking a Bribe of ſeveral thouſand
Guinneas from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador,
to ſave <hi>Wakeman</hi>'s Life; from which
Aſperſions he ſufficiently cleared himſelf
in a Speech which he made in the

the enſuing <hi>Michaelmas-Term.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this interval of Parliament,
the King was violently taken ill of an
<hi>Ague</hi> at <hi>Windſor,</hi> inſomuch, that his
Life was thought to be in ſome danger:
Whereupon the Duke (as well to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
his Affection to his Brother,
as to prevent the danger which, as
things then ſtood, might peradventure
have happen'd to him in caſe the King
ſhould have died in his abſence) came

Poſt from <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>Windſor.</hi> But
Heaven deſigning to lengthen out his
Life, till he had reduced the great
Affairs of the Nation to a better Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,
and could leave his Succeſſion
more ſafe and ſecure; it pleaſed God
that he recovered his Health ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the great Joy of all the whole
Nation. And the City to expreſs the
pleaſure they took therein, ſent the
Lord <hi>Mayor,</hi> and the Court of <hi>Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
with a Train of thirty Coaches,
and about a hundred Horſe, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
him upon his Recovery; and
when he returned ſoon after to <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
many Bonefires were made
throughout the whole City, attended
with great Acclamations of Joy, and
Expreſſions of Loyalty.</p>

ſo inconſiſtent with it ſelf, was the
effect of deep malice in ſome few, and
of looſe and idle diſcourſe in others;

               <p>And we do again upon this occaſion

upon the Faith of a Chriſtian, and
the Word of a King, That there was

not preſume to utter or publiſh any

               </p>
               <p>Whereby all the groundleſs hopes
of that Duke, and the idle and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Expectations of many factious
and deſigning Perſons were wholly
diſappointed. And he was moreover
commanded by the King to depart the
Land, which he did on the <hi>23d</hi> of
<hi>September,</hi> and went over to <hi>

               <p>About this time there was much

               <p>The King having according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,

to Him, which he received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
but knowing that ſuch kind of
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:57792:241"/>
Petitions were rather Commands than
Requeſts, reſolved not to gratifie the

the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> when thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
who were in Town, met according

he acquainted them, That when he
declared in Council his Intention of

mature Conſideration; and that
he ſaw nothing which had hapned ſince

Kingdom, which gave him occaſion
to alter or repent that Reſolution; and
that altho he would in regard to the
preſent danger which threatned ſome
of his Neighbours and Allies, appoint
a day for their meeting again in <hi>April,</hi>
yet the Diſtractions and Jealouſies at
Home were of ſuch a nature, and had
been ſo heightned and improved by
the malice and induſtry of ill men,
that he was unalterably of an opinion,
that a longer interval would be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely

ineffectual without the aſſiſtance of

<pb n="406" facs="tcp:57792:242"/>
that at their meeting in <hi>April,</hi>
there ſhould be a farther prorogation
unleſs the condition of his Allies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,

               <p>In the mean while Articles of high
Miſdemeanor were offered by way of
complaint to the King and Council
againſt the Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> by

And in <hi>Hillary</hi> Term Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coigne</hi>
a <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Gentleman of 85
Years of Age was arraigned at the

High Treaſon; the Witneſſes againſt
him, being <hi>Balron,</hi> and <hi>Mowberry</hi>
two of his own Servants; but their
Evidence being ſomewhat doubtful
and improbable, he was acquitted.</p>
               <p>The King opened the Year 80,
(which was remarkable for many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions,
though all in the end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
peaceable and well) with cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Duke out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who

his Chancellor <hi>Finch</hi> by vertue of

prorogued to the firſt of <hi>July.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now ſeveral Countrys which
had been active in promoting petitions,
began to be aſhamed and recant their
Actions; the City of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the way, their Grand-Jury by a

Action, and charging it on certain facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

informed, he abhorred and diſowned
all ſuch Practices, and humbly begging
his Pardon, he as freely obtained it.</p>
               <p>Upon the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> ſo great a
Storm of Hail fell in <hi>London</hi> and the
adjacent parts, that the like had not
been ſeen in many Years before, the
Stones being of an extraordinary big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and very hard till they had lain a
while, many of them being as large as
<hi>Pullets</hi> Eggs. One which I ſaw meaſured
was ſomewhat more than Nine Inches
about; ſeveral <hi>Rooks</hi> in the <hi>Temple</hi>
Garden being beaten down and killed

And now the Parliament which had

met on the <hi>21ſt</hi> of <hi>October,</hi>
according to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he King's Declaration to

whom he declared, in a Speech to both

and <hi>Spain,</hi> and deſired money of
them for the relieving <hi>Tangier,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

               <p>The Commons having choſen Mr.
<hi>Williams,</hi> a <hi>Barreſter</hi> of <hi>Grays Inn,</hi> and
Recorder of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> for their Speaker,
to convince the World, that the King
had not without Reaſon deferred their

nor the Nation would have been lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
if they had not ſate then, fell to
purging their houſe, expelling Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Can,</hi> a Burgeſs for <hi>Briſtol,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſaid, there was no other Plot but
a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> one; and Sir <hi>Francis

Abhorrer of the late tumultuous Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:57792:244"/>
for the Parliaments ſitting. The
former was committed by them to the
<hi>Tower,</hi> and both ordered to receive
their Cenſure on their knees from the
Speaker: Several other Members were
likewiſe declared guilty of the ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
with Sir <hi>Francis Withins.</hi> And
not content with puniſhing their own
Members, they take notice of others, who
were without their Walls, amongſt
whom Sir <hi>George Jeffries,</hi> Recorder
of <hi>London,</hi> one of the King's Serjeants
at Law, and Chief Juſtice of <hi>Cheſter,</hi>
became the Object of their diſpleaſure,
and was Voted a Betrayer of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Rights; and an Addreſs was made to
the King to remove him from all publick
Affairs: and Impeachments Voted and
drawn up againſt Sir <hi>Francis North,</hi>
Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> Sir
<hi>William Scrogs,</hi> Chief Juſtice of the

               <p>
                  <pb n="411" facs="tcp:57792:244"/>
But not contenting themſelves to
deal with Subjects, they proceeded
next to a matter of a far greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern:
For on the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi>
notwithſtanding the King's deſire at
their opening, That they would not
meddle with the Succeſſion; a Bill paſt
in the Houſe of Commons, intituled,
<hi>An Act for ſecuring the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
by diſabling</hi> James <hi>Duke of</hi>
York <hi>from inheriting the Imperial Crown
of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
thereunto belonging:</hi> which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
all the oppoſition made
againſt it by the unbiaſſed and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Loyaliſts (who tho their Reaſons
were ſtrongeſt, yet their number were
feweſt) was carried up to the Peers by
the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> attended by almoſt
all the Commons, who gave a Hum at
the delivery of it. The Lords having
ordered it, upon their departure, to
be read, put it to the Vote, whether
it ſhould be read a ſecond time; which
being carried in the Affirmative by
Two Voices only, after the ſecond
reading it was debated till Eleven a
Clock at night, the King being preſent
all the while; and then thrown out
of the Houſe by a Majority of about
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:57792:245"/>
Thirty Voices; in which number were
all the Biſhops then preſent, to ſhew
how careful the Prelacy is to promote
Monarchy.</p>
               <p>Soon after the Parliament proceeded
to the Trial of <hi>William</hi> Lord Viſcount
<hi>Stafford,</hi> which began in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi>
on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember;</hi>
and the Impeachment and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
upon the ſame were managed
by a Committee of the Commons; and
the Witneſſes againſt him were <hi>Oates,
Turberville,</hi> and <hi>Dugdale.</hi> The Lord
Chancellor <hi>Finch</hi> was created Lord
High Steward for the ſolemnity of his
Trial, which laſted a whole week; and
being found <hi>Guilty</hi> by the Majority of
Four and Twenty Voices, he received
Sentence on the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>December;</hi> and
on the <hi>29th</hi> of that Month was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> proteſting his
Innocency with his laſt breath; as all
thoſe had done who died for the Plot
before him. Some were ſo bold as to
queſtion the King's power to diſpence
with the Rigor of the Sentence; and
the unhappy Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was ſaid to be
one of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:57792:245"/>
During theſe publick Tranſactions,
a large and prodigious flame of Light
appeared in the <hi>Weſt:</hi> The Star from
which the Blaze proceeded, was but
ſmall; and when firſt diſcovered,
ſeemed to be not much above the <hi>Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon;</hi>
but every night after appeared
ſomewhat higher in the beginning of
the night, and conſequently ſet later,
its luſtre and magnitude decreaſing by
degrees. Whether this finger of the
Almighty ſo viſibly ſeen in the Heavens,
portended good or bad Events to the
World in general, or <hi>England</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
is a matter too myſterious for
me to unfold; and therefore ſhall I leave
it till made more plain by the Effects,
which will be the beſt Commentatary
thereon.</p>
               <p>The King finding the Commons ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up with other buſineſs, without
taking the leaſt care of providing him
Money for the ſupplying his preſſing
wants, and the relieving <hi>Tangier,</hi> then
beſieged by the Emperor of <hi>Morocco,</hi>
recommended the matter more ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to them, in his Speech on the <hi>15th</hi> of
<hi>December:</hi> But all the Anſwer he could
obtain from them, was an Addreſs,
complaining of ſeveral pretended
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:57792:246"/>
Grievances, and refuſing all ſupplies of
Money for the Relief of <hi>Tangier,</hi> or
any other uſe, unleſs he would paſs a
Bill for the Excluſion of the Duke;
and to enable all Proteſtants to aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
themſelves for the ſecurity of the
Proteſtant Religion: which Addreſs he
anſwered by a meſſage to the Commons,
wherein he let them know, That he
had received their Addreſs with all the
diſpoſition they could wiſh to comply
with their reaſonable deſires; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
peruſal of it, he was ſorry to ſee
their thoughts ſo fixt on the Bill of
Excluſion, as to determine all other
Remedies for the ſuppreſſing of it, to
be ineffectual; telling them, That he
was confirmed in his Opinion againſt
the Bill by the Judgment of the Lords,
in their rejecting it; adviſing them to
conſider of all other means for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Proteſtant Religion, to
which they ſhould have no Reaſon to
doubt his concurrence; and urging
them again to make ſome ſpeedy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for the preſervation of <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the conſideration of which
Speech, they were ſo far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
with his reaſonable deſires, that
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:57792:246"/>
they Reſolved, as the Opinion of the
Houſe, That there was no ſecurity for
the Proteſtant Religion, the King's
Life, or the well Conſtituted and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Government of this Kingdom,
without the Bill of Excluſion; and
that to rely upon any other Remedy,
were inſufficient and dangerous: That
till ſuch a Bill was paſt, they could give
the King no ſupply without danger to
his Perſon, hazard to the Proteſtant
Religion, and unfaithfulneſs to thoſe
by whom they were truſted: And that
all perſons who adviſed him in that
Meſſage to inſiſt upon an Opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Excluſion-Bill, had given
him pernicious Counſel, and were
promoters of <hi>Popery,</hi> and Enemies
both to him and the Kingdom; naming
<hi>Hallifax, Worceſter, Clarendon, Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham,</hi>
and <hi>Laurence Hide,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> againſt
whom they Voted an Addreſs to the
King, to remove them from all Offices
of honour and profit, and from his
Councils and preſence forever: Voting
moreover, That whoſoever ſhall Lend,
or cauſe to be Lent by way of Advance,
any Money upon the branches of the
King's Revenue, ariſing by <hi>Custom,
Exciſe,</hi> or <hi>Hearth-Money,</hi> ſhould be
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:57792:247"/>
adjudged to hinder the ſitting of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
and ſhould be reſponſible for
the ſame. But their preſumption run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſo high, the King reſolved, by a
Prorogation, to give them time to cool
themſelves, which he did on the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
following, being the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>July;</hi>
when he paſt Two Bills, one about <hi>Iriſh</hi>
Cattel, and the other for burying in
Woollen; the latter whereof proved
very advantageous to the Nation by
the advance of Wool, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the moſt ſtaple Commodity of
this Kingdom. The Commons, by
ſome means or other, were informed of
the King's deſign of proroguing them;
and therefore ſo ſoon as they were ſet
that morning, the very firſt thing they
did, was to thunder out their Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Votes, That whoſoever adviſed
the King to prorogue that Parliament,
to any other purpoſe than in order to
the paſſing the Bill of Excluſion,
ſhould be lookt upon as a Betrayer of
the King, the Proteſtant Religion, and
the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> a promoter
of the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and a Penſioner
to <hi>France.</hi>

And in a Common-Council, aſſembled
bout Two or Three days after in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don,</hi>
a Petition was ordered to be

the other Four; and having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peacht
the Chief Juſtice, and being
about to impeach other Judges, and all
in order to the preſervation of his
Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were much ſurpriſed
to ſee it prorogued in the height of
their buſineſs: and that their only
hope was, its being done with a deſign
to bring ſuch Affairs about again, as
were neceſſary to the ſetling the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Praying that they might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſit at the day appointed, and ſo
continue till they had effected the great
Affairs before them. But before the
<hi>20th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> arrived, to which
they had been prorogued, the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
them diſſolved by Proclamation,
and intimated his pleaſure to call ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

to the Swords of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and
their Adherents; whereby their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Speech would be deſtroyed,
and the Validity of their Acts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
left diſputable. Urging like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the ſtraitneſs of the place, which
they affirmed was altogether unfit for
the entertaining ſuch a concourſe of
perſons as now followed every Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And that the Witneſſes which
were to give Evidence upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
Impeachment, were unable to
bear the charges of that Journey, and
unwilling to truſt themſelves under the
protection of a Parliament, which was
it ſelf under the power of Guards and
Soldiers; praying it might therefore ſit
at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parliament which met at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>

Eight days before their ſitting, the
King having appointed certain Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of Foot, and ſeveral Troops of
Horſe to keep Guard in the <hi>Mews</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his abſence, removed to <hi>Oxford,</hi>
where he was received and preſented
by the Mayor and Body of that City,
at the <hi>Eaſt-Gate,</hi> and from thence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with great Acclamations, and
all other demonſtrations of Joy; and
was the next day waited on and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented
by the body of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
who preſented him with a large
<hi>Oxford-Bible,</hi> and the Queen with the
Cuts belonging to the <hi>Hiſtory and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity;</hi> both richly
bound.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the Members, as well Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
as Lords, went thither, attended
with a numerous Train of Friends.
At the opening of the Seſſions, the
King told them, That the unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
proceedings of the laſt Houſe of
Commons, was the only Reaſon why
he had diſſolved them: And that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s he
would never uſe Arbitrary Government
himſelf, ſo he was Reſolved never to
ſuffer it in others. That whoſoever
ſhould calmly conſider the proceedings
in the laſt Parliament, might perhaps
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:57792:249"/>
wonder at his patience ſo long, rather
than that he grew weary at laſt. That it
was as much his intereſt and care as
theirs, to preſerve the Liberty of the
Subject, ſince the Crown could not be
ſafe when that was in danger: And
that neither Liberty nor Property
could long ſubſiſt, when the juſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives
of the Crown were invaded,
or the Honour of the Government
brought low, and into diſreputation:
Aſſuring them, That he had called them
ſo ſoon, to ſhew that the Irregularities
of Parliaments ſhould never make him
out of love with them: And that he
thought the juſt care they ought to
have of Religion, ſhould not be ſo
managed and improved into unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Fears, as to be made a pretence
for changing the Foundation of the
Government: and therefore hoped the
Example of the former ill ſucceſs which
had attended ſuch kind of Heats,
would diſpoſe them to a better Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and prevent their laying ſo much
weight upon any One Expedient, as to
refuſe all others as ineffectual and to no
purpoſe; adviſing them to remember,
that without the Safety and Dignity of
the Monarchy, neither Religion nor
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:57792:249"/>
Property could be preſerved, which
was the Reaſon why he had not, nor
could not depart from what he had
formerly ſo often declared touching the
Succeſſion. But to remove all reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Fears which might ariſe from the
poſſibility of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſſor's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Crown, if means could be
found out, that in ſuch a caſe the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of the Government might
remain in Proteſtant hands, he ſhould
be ready to hearken to any ſuch Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
whereby Religion might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
and Monarchy not deſtroyed;
wiſhing them to provide for both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſupported each other. And
that they would make the known E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſht
Laws of the Land the Rules
and Meaſures of all their Votes; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
them, that he wonld ever
make them the Rules of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>After the Speech, the Commons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired

And that for any Inferior
Court to proceed againſt him, or any
other perſon impeacht by Parliament,
was an high Breach of the priviledges
of Parliaments. And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the many miſchiefs that had always
followed upon, and were the Natural
Conſequences of ſuch Attempts, on
<hi>Monday</hi> following a Bill was brought
likewiſe into that Parliament againſt
the Duke's Succeſſion: And having
been read once, was ordered a ſecond
reading. Whereupon the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
it would be impoſſible for
them to do any thing that might tend
to the Honour and Settlement of the
Nation, whilſt the Two Houſes were
ſo divided with Heats and Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
and the Commons time wholly
taken up in debating a matter that no
way concerned them, reſolved to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
his power for deciding the
quarrel, and convince them, That he
would no longer endure to be trifled
with and affronted: And therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſent for the Commons to the
Houſe of Lords, he told them, That
to prevent the ill Effects he foreſaw
would follow upon the Heats between
them and the Lords, he had ordered
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:57792:251"/>
the Chancellor to diſſolve them, which
was done immediately, and the King
returned the ſame night to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and
the next morning to <hi>White-Hall.</hi> And
knowing how induſtrious ſome ill
minded perſons would be to improve
that Diſſolution for the miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Actions; to prevent his Subjects
being deluded by their fair pretences,
and bold, tho falſe Affirmations, he
publiſht a Declaration, wherein he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
them with the Reaſons which
induced him to diſſolve both that and
the laſt <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Parliament: and
aſſured them, That he was not however
out of love with Parliaments, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the unwarrantable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Two former; but
would frequently adviſe with them,
as his great Council, in hopes ere long
to find his people in a better Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>As the diſſolution of this Parliament
was accounted by the more Intelligent
a very wiſe and politick Act, from
whence he might expect many good
effects; ſo the conſequence anſwered
the Expectation: for now all the
Weekly Intelligences, and the factiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had vomited out in great Numbers
whilſt they expected impunity from
the Parliament, were ſuppreſt, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
buſht into ſilence by an Order of
Council.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Pemberton</hi> ſucceeding
<hi>Scroggs</hi> in the Chief Juſticeſhip, great
Expectation there was to ſee what
would be done in the caſe of <hi>Fitz-Harris;</hi>
but all the Judges of <hi>England</hi>
having met about it in the Exchequer-Chamber,
they reſolved that they
might notwithſtanding the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the Commons Vote, proceed
to try him: And the next day a Bill
was preferred and found by the Grand-Jury
of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and thereupon he
was on the laſt day of the Term ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned
at the Bar of the Kings-Bench.
But being Three ſeveral Times bid to
hold up his hand, he refuſed, inſiſting
upon his impeachment in Parliament,
and his right to be tried before them;
but being at laſt prevailed upon to
hold up his hand, and hear his Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
read, which was for High Treaſon,
expreſt in a certain Writing, call'd,
<hi>The True Engliſh Man,</hi> full of moſt
horrid Expreſſions againſt the King,
as if he had been a Conſpirator in the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:57792:252"/>
Plot againſt himſelf, and thereupon
exciting the Nation to riſe againſt him
as one man; he put in a dilatory Plea
againſt the Juriſdiction of the Court;
alledging, that having been impeached
by the Commons in Parliament, he could
not be tried there; but the Plea being
not under Councils Hand, was refuſed.
However he had Time given him to
conſider whether he would ſtand by
ſuch a Plea, in regard it might prove
fatal to him, in caſe it ſhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled;
and <hi>Winnington, Williams, Pollix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen</hi>
and <hi>Wallop</hi> were aſſigned him for
Council according to his deſire, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
the ſaid point of Judicature the
next <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> if he reſolved to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in his Plea; which he reſolving to do
on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> was brought again to the
Bar, attended with his Council, when
the Attorney-General entred a Demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to his Plea, and <hi>Saturday</hi> Morning was
appointed for his Council to maintain
his Plea by Argument, if they could;
and the Court having then heard what
could be ſaid on both ſides, declared
that they meddled not at all with the
Priviledg of the Houſe of Commons,
or the Juriſdiction of the Lords in
Parliament, but only with the Form
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:57792:252"/>
of the Plea; and after the debate was
over, the Chief Juſtice declared they
would take a convenient time to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
before they would give their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following being
brought again to the Bar, the Court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
they had conſidered the Plea, and
conſulted with other Judges about it;
and were of opinion, it was inſufficient;
and was therefore overruled, and the
Priſoner ordered to plead over; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he pleaded Not guilty, and had
till the firſt Thurſday in the next
Term allowed him for his Tryal.</p>
               <p>In the mean while many Loyal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
flowed from all parts of the
Nation full of Congratulations and
Thanks to the King for his late Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And in <hi>Trinity-Term,</hi> Dr. <hi>Oliver
Plunket</hi> was Try'd for High-Treaſon,
the Evidence againſt him being all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
Papiſts, affirmed he was made Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of <hi>Ireland</hi> by the Pope at the
<hi>French</hi> Kings Recommendation; and
that he having thereupon engaged to
do that King all the Service he could,
had actually levied amongſt his Popiſh
Clergy great Sums of Money to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:57792:253"/>
the <hi>French</hi> Dominion, and extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
the Proteſtants out of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
upon which evidence he was
found Guilty, and was together with
<hi>Fitz-harris,</hi> who received his Tryal
the next day, executed at <hi>Tyburn</hi> on
the firſt of the following <hi>July,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting
his innocency, and praying for
the King, Queen, and Duke.</p>
               <p>Preſently after the Tryal of <hi>Fitz-Harris,</hi>
his Wife and Maid accuſed the
Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of <hi>Eſcrick</hi> of contriving
the Treaſonable Libel for which he
was convicted, who was thereupon
committed to the Tower: And in a
Paper delivered at his Execution to
Dr. <hi>Haukins</hi> Miniſter of the Tower,
for his Wife, he confirmed that accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
denying what he had formerly
confeſt about <hi>Danby</hi> and the Plot; affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
he was drawn into that confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
only through hopes of ſaving his

againſt <hi>Howard</hi> being delivered
on the laſt day of the Term to the

ſworn to by <hi>Fitz-harris</hi>'s Wife, and Maid,

               <p>The Reaſon why ſome Perſons went

whilſt he was there, and ſeveral factious
People were thereupon committed to
the Tower, viz. <hi>Rouſe, Haynes, White,
Colledg,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi>
whoſe Papers were likewiſe ſeiz'd. At
the Seſſions which began ſoon after, he
and <hi>Howard</hi> moved to be bailed, but
the Judges told them, it lay not in
their power to bail out of the Tower.</p>
               <p>At this Seſſions, and Indictment of
High Treaſon was preferred to the

and ever loved to meddle moſt with

               <p>In a Parliament held at this time in

an Act was paſt which aſſerted the

as a former Jury had done that of

aſſaulted thoſe who were Witneſſes

the Sheriffs to prevent miſchief, were
forced to guard them as far as the <hi>Savoy</hi>

made by the Rabble almoſt in every

it, and declared their Indignation in

In <hi>February,</hi> 1682, there hapned a
ſtrange and Barbarous Murder, which
for the boldneſs of the Attempt, and
the baſeneſs of the manner wherein it
was perpetrated, is ſcarcely to be parel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd

fatal to theſe Nations, by depriving

the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> our Preſent

of <hi>May</hi> into <hi>Scotland</hi> to fetch home his
Dutcheſs, whom he had left there at

the Royal Paſſenger to be the
occaſion of many future Bleſſings to
theſe Kingdoms, and reſerving him for
a more honourable Funeral, he was
miraculouſly preſerved by going off
into a Yatch, which came up to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

returning toward the latter end of

               <p>And the King, who went back again

ſome Diſputes ariſing when the Mayor

were ſent for to the Court of Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

wherein he commanded them, ſince all

manner, as they ought to have been

upon <hi>Midſummerday.</hi> This Order was
read in the <hi>Common-Hall;</hi> but oppoſed
by the adverſe Party with Noiſe and
Clamor. However, <hi>Moor</hi> declared
<hi>North</hi> duly elected by him; and that
he would Poll for the other Three;
<hi>viz. Box, Papillion,</hi> and <hi>Duboiſe:</hi> and
thereupon cauſed Books to be fitted
with Three Columns only: But <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinton</hi>

Books to be caſt up, and finding the
Majority of Voices to be for <hi>Box,</hi> he
declared <hi>North</hi> and him to be Sheriffs.
But <hi>Box</hi> refuſing to ſerve, and paying

would abide by their former Choice
for <hi>Papillion</hi> and <hi>Duboiſe,</hi> proceeded
likewiſe to a Poll; and having caſt up
their Books, declared them to be She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs
Elect. Whereupon the Mayor
acquainting the King with their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
he commanded them to attend
him in Council, where they were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely

giving ſufficient Bail to anſwer to an

               <p>But notwithſtanding this ill ſucceſs,
they were not ſo diſcouraged as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt

For on <hi>Michaelmas-day,</hi> when the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens

               <p>This year was very remarkable alſo
for the Arrival of Two Extraordinary
and Famous Embaſſages from Two
Princes never known to have ſent any
into <hi>England</hi> before, one from the
Emperor of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco</hi> (who in
his Letter expreſt much Kindneſs, and
a great Veneration to the King): His
Name was <hi>Hamet Benhamet Benhaddu
Otter;</hi> a man of a Majeſtick Preſence,
and great Wiſdom: His buſineſs was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſetling a Peace in relation to <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier;</hi>
and his Perſon and Converſation
was ſo pleaſant and taking, that he was
received and careſſed with more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Reſpect, both by the King
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:57792:260"/>
and his Nobles, than any Embaſſador I
ever knew at Court: And ſo he was by
both Univerſities, which he viſited;
ſeeming to have an equal Eſteem and
Valuation for our Nation. Nor was
there ever any Embaſſador before him
ſo much admired by the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
great multitudes always attending
before his Houſe, which was near <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine-ſtreet</hi>
in the <hi>Strand,</hi> to gaze
upon, and wonder at the ſtrange Garb
worn by him and his Attendants, one
whereof was an <hi>Engliſh Renegado,</hi>
formerly a <hi>Barber</hi> ſomewhere about
<hi>Temple bar;</hi> but being afterward a
Soldier in <hi>Tangier,</hi> he ran away from
that Gariſon to the <hi>Moors,</hi> and was by
them highly advanced for his perfidious
directing them in their Wars againſt that
Town.</p>
               <p>The other Embaſſage was from the
King of <hi>Bantham,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
whoſe buſineſs was about the <hi>East-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
Trade, who would have been as
much admired as the former, if he had
come another time; but all mens Eyes
were ſo generally fixt upon the <hi>Moroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi>
that they were leſs minded than
otherwiſe they would have been.
They brought the King ſeveral rich
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:57792:261"/>
preſents of <hi>Diamonds,</hi> and other things
of great value. But not long after
their return, we received ill news

and unuſual attempt, to prevent Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults.
But one <hi>Fletcher,</hi> a Serjeant
of the <hi>Poultrey-Compter,</hi> having an
Action of Debt, upon a Bond of 400.
<hi>l.</hi> agaiuſt <hi>Broome,</hi> who had the Week
before promiſed to give Bail to it; but
neglecting it, and ſeeing him act ſo
imperiouſly againſt the Chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
of the City, took him into cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody,
and carried him forthwith to
the <hi>Compter.</hi> The Mayor, and his
Fellow-priſoners, ſeeing <hi>Broome</hi> carried
away by a Serjeant, demanded if there
were any in the houſe who had Orders
to detain them; which being anſwered
in the Negative, they all peaceably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to their ſeveral homes.</p>
               <p>In the next Month was tried at
<hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> before the Lord Chief
Juſtice <hi>Saunders (Pemberton</hi> having
been removed to the <hi>Common-Pleas</hi>
upon <hi>North</hi>'s receiving the Seal), the
great <hi>Riot</hi> committed the year before
at the Election of Sheriffs, Fourteen
being found Guilty thereof, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>And the better part of the City,
both for Number and Quality, Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at a <hi>Common-Council,</hi> held on the
<hi>22d</hi> of that Month, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:57792:262"/>
the Action in which the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
was Arreſted at the Suit of <hi>Papillion</hi>
and <hi>Duboiſe,</hi> was ſaid to be proſecuted
at the Inſtance of the Citizens of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
yet they to deliver themſelves and
the ſaid Citizens from that falſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
did declare, they were no way
privy or conſenting to that Action; and
therefore did diſown and diſapprove
the ſame.</p>
               <p>But the City having in the Judgment
of Lawyers, forfeited their Charter
by ſeveral illegal proceedings, the King
thought the beſt way to prevent ſuch
kind of Tumults, which might be of
ill conſequence to the Nation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
for the future, would be the taking
that Forfeiture, that ſo by having the
<hi>Charter</hi> delivered up into his hands,
they might by a more abſolute depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
upon his Goodneſs, be obliged to
a ſtricter performance of their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and take the greater care to
preſerve the publick peace and quiet.
Whereupon he ordered a Writ of <hi>Quo
Warranto</hi> to go out againſt their <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
which was grounded chiefly on
their illegal exacting of Tolls in their
Markets, and their having framed and
printed a ſcandalous Petition, wherein
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:57792:262"/>
the King is charged with obſtructing the
Juſtice of the Nation by proroguing the
laſt Parliament.</p>
               <p>Whether theſe were ſufficient grounds
of ſeizing their Liberties, were argued
<hi>Pro &amp; Con,</hi> firſt by the Solicitor Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
and the Recorder of the City,
and then by the Attorney General and
Mr. <hi>Pollixfen.</hi> And Judg <hi>Jones</hi> (the
Lord Chief Juſtice being then ſick)
having ſumm'd up all the proceedings
in a very ſignificant and ſolid Speech,
gave Judgment upon it; and declared
it to be the unanimous Opinion of
that Court, That the Liberties and
Franchiſes of the City of <hi>London</hi> ſhould
be ſeized into the King's hands. But
Judgment was not entred up, in regard
the King had expreſly commanded that
ſhould not be done till his pleaſure was
further known.</p>
               <p>The City now finding the King was
in earneſt, and that their <hi>Charter</hi> was
condemned by Law, began to think
of humbling themſelves at his feet, and
ſue for Mercy: And therefore at a
Common-Council call'd for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
a Petition was ordered to be
drawn up and preſented to him at
<hi>Windſor,</hi> where he then was; in which
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:57792:263"/>
they acknowledg their hearty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
ſorrow for the miſgovernment
of that City, which had occaſioned the
<hi>Quo Warranto</hi> to be brought againſt
them, and Judgment to be paſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon:
And thankfully acknowledged
his great Favour in not requiring Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be immediately entred thereon;
in which diſtreſſed condition they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
caſt themſelves at his Royal Feet,
imploring his Princely Compaſſion and
Grace; begging his pardon for all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
with moſt ſolemn promiſes and
aſſurances of conſtant Loyalty and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to him and his Succeſſors, and
of a Regular Adminiſtration of his
Government in that City for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
humbly begging his Commands
and Directions therein. This Petition
was carried and preſented by the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or,
and ſeveral Loyal Aldermen and
Citizens. Upon the Receipt whereof,
the Lord Keeper, by the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
declared, That for the ſakes of
ſo many of the preſent Magiſtrates, and
other Eminent Citizens, who were of
undoubted Loyalty and Affection to
his Service, he would ſhow the City
all the Favour they could reaſonably
deſire, if they would ſubmit to ſuch
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:57792:263"/>
Regulations as he thought neceſſary
forthe aſſuring the Loyalty, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the Peace of that City; <hi>viz.</hi>
That no perſon ſhould be admitted to
be Mayor, Sheriff, Recorder, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Serjeant, Town-Clerk, or Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>London,</hi> or Steward of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark,</hi>
before they were approved by him
under his Sign Manual: And that after
he had Twice diſapproved the Mayor
whom they ſhould preſent to him, he
might, if he pleaſed, nominate one
himſelf: and ſo alſo for the Sheriff;
the Election being nevertheleſs to be
ſtill continued according to the ancient
Cuſtoms and Uſages of the City, with
ſome ſmall Reſtrictions only then ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified:
which gracious Offer was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by a Common-Council aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
on the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>June;</hi> where the
Queſtion being propounded, it was
carried in the Affirmative by the Majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Eighteen Voices.</p>
               <p>And now came to light one of the
baſeſt and vileſt pieces of Treachery
that was ever hatcht in the World;
which ſeemed to point out and explain
whereto the <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> and
the Treacherous <hi>Aſſociation</hi> tended:
For thoſe Factious and Deſigning
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:57792:264"/>
Wretches having failed of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Deſigns by thoſe ſpecious
pretences, reſolved to attempt that by
force which they now found they
could not effect by Fraud: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
entred into a Damnable Plot and
Conſpiracy to Murder the King and
His Brother, and alter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
To effect which, they had at
ſeveral Treaſonable Conſultations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to Levy men, and make an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.
For the management where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they made choice of a Council of
Six, that were to direct and order the
chief matters relating thereunto; <hi>viz.</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> the Lord
<hi>Ruſſel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> and Collonel
<hi>Sidney:</hi> Beſides which, there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Council of more Inferior perſons,
whoſe buſineſs was to conſult chiefly
about the Aſſaſſination of the King and
the Duke.</p>
               <p>The King and the Duke being both
at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> they reſolved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their ever coming to <hi>London</hi> again,
by cutting them both off in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:
To which end, <hi>Weſt,</hi> by the
appointment of the reſt, had provided
ſeveral Muſquets, and other Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:57792:264"/>
which were to have been ſent down
to a Houſe call'd the <hi>Rye,</hi> inhabited by
one <hi>Rumball,</hi> about three Miles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<hi>Hodſden,</hi> which was lookt upon
as the moſt convenient place for that
monſtrous and helliſh deſign, in regard
therewas by the houſe a narrow paſſage,
through which the King uſually came,
when he went to and from <hi>Newmarket;</hi>
ſo that it would have been hard for him
to have eſcaped: But Heaven having
preſerved him from the many former
Attempts of Men of the like Principles,
and diſdaining that Hell ſhould fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
its deſigned bleſſings to theſe
Nations as well in the remainder of his
Reign, as in his next Succeſſors, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off its Principal Favourite, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to render former Mercies the
more compleat and full, by adding a
new one to their Number, no leſs
apparent and viſible than his Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in the Oak had been: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Fire which hapned <hi>there,</hi> and
conſumed the greateſt part of the
Town, forced him to return ſooner
than they expected, and before they
were ready for him; whereby they
were diſappointed of their Barbarous
Purpoſe, and not a little confounded
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:57792:265"/>
at the Strangeneſs of the Thing, which
altho it appeared at firſt ſight to be pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accidental, yet afterward was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lookt upon to fall out by the ſpecial
deſignation of Divine Providence.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this remarkable
diſappointment, and the conſternation
which at firſt ſeized them upon the
news of it, they ſtill went on with
their Plot, and conſulted about ſome
other Time and Place for their Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation:
But before they could bring
their diſtracted Counſels to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
Providence ſpoiled their Plot:
For, one of the Conſpirators, whoſe
Name was <hi>Keeling,</hi> being convinced of
the Wickedneſs of the deſign, through
the care of Heaven to prevent it, by the
remarkable Fire at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> was ſo
terrified, that he could not reſt till he
had made a diſcovery of it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Weſt,</hi> a Councellor of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
was apprehended, and a Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
iſſued out for the declaring <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,
Rumball, Nelthrop, Wade, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough,
Wallcot, Thompſon, Burton,</hi>
and <hi>Hone,</hi> Traytors; offering 100 re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to any that ſhould diſcover
them; and another againſt <hi>Monmouth,
Grey, Armſtrong,</hi> and <hi>Ferguſon; Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi>
                  <pb n="453" facs="tcp:57792:265"/>
the Lord <hi>Ruſſel, Eſſex,</hi> Collonel
<hi>Sidney,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hambden,</hi> the Lord <hi>Howard,
Walcot, Rouſe, Hone,</hi> and ſome others
were taken, but the reſt made their
eſcape beyond the Seas: The Lord
<hi>Grey</hi> indeed was taken, but being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Examination by the King and
Council committed to the Tower,
he found means to make his eſcape out
of the Coach, juſt as he came almoſt
at the Tower Gate, having made <hi>Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
the Meſſenger who had him in
Charge, ſo drunk, (as it was reported)
that he fell faſt aſleep, and left him
wholly unguarded.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Sidney</hi>
were beheaded; and <hi>Walcot, Rouſe,</hi>
and <hi>Hone</hi> executed at <hi>Tyburn</hi> for this
Plot. The Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> prevented
the Hand of Juſtice by cutting his own
Throat; Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> againſt whom
there was but one Evidence, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indicted, and found guilty of a high
Treſpaſs and Miſdemeanor, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
in a Fine of 40000 <hi>l.</hi> to the
King, to find Sureties for his Good
Behaviour during Life, and to ſtand
committed till that was paid and done.
The Lord <hi>Brandon,</hi> Major <hi>Wildman,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Charlton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Trenchard,</hi> and ſome
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:57792:266"/>
others for want of ſufficient Evidence,
were firſt admitted to bail, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
diſcharged: Mr. <hi>Wade</hi> and Sir
<hi>Thomas Armſtrong</hi> being both taken
beyond the Seas; the firſt at <hi>Mevis,</hi>
and the other in <hi>Holland,</hi> were brought
into <hi>England,</hi> and condemned and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
upon an Outlawry.</p>
               <p>The King to ſhew his Senſe of the
Divine Goodneſs for his wonderful
and Gracious Preſervation from that
horrid Plot and Conſpiracy, publiſht
a Declaration for a ſolemn Day of
Thankſgiving to Almighty God, to be
celebrated throughout the Kingdom on
Sunday the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>Septemb.</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Declaration, which contained
a ſhort Narration of the Treaſonable
Conſpiracy, and the Perſons concerned
therein (ſome whereof were not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in either of the Proclamations)
to be read on Sunday the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi>
as well as on the Day of
Thankſgiving, which was obſerved
with great Seriouſneſs and Devotion
throughout the whole Kingdom, every
one looking upon himſelf to have a
particular Intereſt in the Benefit of
that Preſervation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="455" facs="tcp:57792:266"/>
It is obſervable, that there was this
remarkable difference between the two
Plots; all thoſe who died for the firſt,
proteſted their Innocency with their
laſt breath, denying that they had any
knowledg of a Plot or Conſpiracy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on againſt the King or the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and all thoſe who died for
the Second did acknowledg ſomething,
tho they denied the greater part of
what they were accuſed of.</p>
               <p>About this time the Lady <hi>Ann,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Daughter to his Royal Highneſs
the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> was married to
Prince <hi>George,</hi> Brother to the King of
<hi>Denmark,</hi> the Ceremony being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> in
the Preſence of the King, Queen, Duke
and Dutcheſs, with moſt of the
Great Perſons about the Court; and
that Night was obſerved with great
Joy and Splendor; and the next, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Day for the Election of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs

<pb n="456" facs="tcp:57792:267"/>
of courſe uſed to be the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi>
was this Year adjourned to the <hi>5th</hi> of

a Choice of Mayor on <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-day
was likewiſe adjourned for ſix Days. But
in the mean time, the King being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſpleaſed with the Cities delays in
ſigning the particulars formerly accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of, and promiſed by the Common-Council,
in Relation to the Charter,
cauſed his Attorney to enter up Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
againſt it, and thereupon gave
his commiſſion to Sir <hi>William Prit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to execute the Office of Lord Mayor
of that City during pleaſure; granting
the like Commiſſions alſo to the two
New Sheriffs, <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Daſhwood,</hi>
who were thereupon ſworn with the
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:57792:267"/>
uſual Oaths, and Mr. <hi>Jenner</hi> of the
<hi>Inner Temple,</hi> knighted at the ſame time
by the Name of Sir <hi>Thomas Jenner,</hi> the
Kings Recorder of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> the
Mayor and Sheriffs appeared at <hi>Guild-hall</hi>
Chappel as formerly in their Gowns
and Chains, but the Aldermen only in
their ordinary habits, being by vertue
of that new Commiſſion, only made
Juſtices of the Peace; eight of the
Factious ones being left out, and
their Number ſupplied by as many
Worthy and Loyal Gentlemen; <hi>viz.</hi>
Sir <hi>Benjamin Newland,</hi> Sir <hi>Benjamin
Bathurſt,</hi> Sir <hi>John Buckworth,</hi> Sheriff
<hi>Daſhwood, Charles Duncomb, Jacob Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Peter Palavazine,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin
Thoroughgood.</hi> But on the <hi>13th</hi> of
that Month the King ſent them a new
Commiſſion, wherein he impowered
them to act as Aldermen in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Wards, and accordingly divers of
them attended the Mayor the next
day to Chappel after their uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in Gowns and Chains; and the
next Week aſſembled a Court of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen
as formerly: And upon the
<hi>29th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> which is the Annual
Day for ſwearing the Lord Mayor of
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:57792:268"/>
                  <hi>London,</hi> the King having appointed
Sir <hi>Henry Tulſe</hi> to execute that Office
by Commiſſion during his pleaſure;
he was after the uſual manner attended
to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> by the Companies, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the accuſtomed Ceremonies in
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Hall, and making the uſual
Cavalcade through <hi>London,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Pageants.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
as one of the Conſpirators in the
late Plot, abſconded, and lay concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
for ſome time; ſo as he could not
be found by all the ſearch that was
made for him: But having privately
made his Application to the King in
an humble and ſubmiſſive Letter,
wherein he intirely reſigned himſelf
to his Majeſties Diſpoſal; the Duke
thereupon went down to Secretary
<hi>Jenkins</hi> his Office, to whom he had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
ſurrendred himſelf, and upon
ſhewing himſelf very ſenſible of his
Crime in ſuffering himſelf to be
drawn into a Conſpiracy againſt the
King and Government, and making a
full Declaration of it, and a particular
Submiſſion to his Royal Highneſs for
his misbehaviour toward him, he did
upon the requeſt and Mediation of the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:57792:268"/>
Duke obtain his Pardon, and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torny-General
was ordered to ſtop all
further Proceedings againſt him;
But refuſing afterwards to make the
promiſed Diſcovery, or to ſign what he
had confeſt, he fell again into the
Kings High Diſpleaſure, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
baniſht the Court, and expelled
the Royal Preſence.</p>
               <p>About the middle of <hi>December</hi> this
Year, began a very extraordinary Froſt,
which laſted till the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>February;</hi>
during which time the <hi>Thames</hi> was fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
over with ſolid and contiguous
Ice, with thouſands of People walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereon, and whole ſtreets of
Booths built quite a croſs, and ſhops of
almoſt all manner of Trades on each
ſide, as in the high ſtreets of <hi>London,</hi>
and Coaches running almoſt as thick as
in <hi>Fleetſtreet.</hi> The extremity of the
Weather was ſuch, that great numbers
of poor and indigent People, who at
other times could but juſt live, were
now (in regard they could not follow
their imployment) brought into great
neceſſities, and many of them muſt
have ſtarved if the charity of others
had not relieved 'em; whereupon the
King, who always loved to take all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:57792:269"/>
to expreſs his charity and
affection to his Subjects, eſpecially thoſe
that were poor and indigent among
them, granted his Letters Mandatory
to the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> to make a
Collection in all Pariſhes in the City
and Suburbs for the Relief of many
Thouſand miſerable Wretches, who
would otherwiſe have periſhed; and
to encourage others to ſo needful a
charity by his own example, ordered
ſeveral great Sums of Money to be
iſſued out of his Treaſury for that
Purpoſe. On the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>January,</hi>
being the firſt day of <hi>Hillary</hi> Term,
the Lawyers went over the <hi>Ice</hi> to
<hi>Westminster,</hi> and back again as famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
as on the Land, ſome on Foot, and
others in Coaches; and there was for
above a fortnight together a Fair or
Mart kept between the Temple, and
that part of <hi>Southwark</hi> which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to it.</p>
               <p>This Year <hi>Vienna</hi> the Imperial City
of <hi>Germany,</hi> was cloſely beſieged, and
greatly diſtreſſed by the <hi>Turks,</hi> who
brought it to the very laſt extremity,
but were then beaten off, and forced
to raiſe their ſiege, by the Bleſſing of
God, upon the Valour of the King of
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:57792:269"/>
                  <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi>
in which Action, the Lord <hi>Landſdown,</hi>
Eldeſt Son to the Earl of <hi>Bath,</hi> beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himſelf with ſo much Valour, that
he was afterward, as a Reward of his
Courage, created a Count of the Sacred
Empire.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Tangier,</hi> having coſt the King
abundance of Treaſure to defend it
againſt the <hi>Moors,</hi> and make the Mole
there, he now reſolved in regard the
charges were ſo very great, and the
Expectation of Advantage very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
to relinquiſh it; and therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the Lord <hi>Dartmouth</hi> to repair
thither wih about 20 ſail of Ships, and
demoliſh the Town, Caſtle, and Mole,
choak up the Haven (to render it uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
to any who might otherwiſe have
thought the Town worth rebuilding)
and bring off the Inhabitants, which
was done accordingly.</p>
               <p>About the middle of <hi>February,</hi> 1684.
was the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> after a long
and tedious Impriſonment, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Bail, by the Eminent and Loyal

who ever loved to endear his Subjects

That ſome Hours after the

appeared, which wlth the Bleſſing of
God improved by the Application of
proper and ſeaſonable Remedies, was
then ſo far advanc'd, that the Phyſicians
conceiv'd him to be in a condition of

days be freed from his Diſtemper.</p>
               <p>The People in divers Places of the
Country where it had been poſitively

news of his Recovery with incredible
joy, expreſt by the Ringing of Bells,
and Bonfires; but in few days all was
dampt again by the certain and unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
news of his Death; For when
neither the endeavours of men, nor
the invocations of Heaven could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
he expired on Friday the Sixth
of <hi>February,</hi> having lain all that time
in abundance of pain and miſery,
which he endur'd with incredible Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
often lifting up his hands and
eyes to Heaven, and breathing forth
the fervent deſires o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his Holy and
Pious Soul, in ſeveral Short but ſweet
and Pathetick Ejaculations. Kings
in reſpect of their Office are ſtiled
<hi>Gods</hi> in the Sacred Writ, and are, like
him, immortal, and therefore can never
die; but their Perſons being made of
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:57792:275"/>
the ſame mouldring Principles with
the meaneſt of their Subjects, they muſt
die like men; and when the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for their diſſolution is come,
it is impoſſible either for men or
Angels, Phyſick or Phyſicians to detain
them longer here; for they may with
as much eaſe diſſolve the Covenant of
the Night and Day, keep the Sea from
flowing, and the Sun from ſhining, as
preſerve Kings from being hurried, as
well as the reſt of mankind, to the
place appointed for all Living.</p>
               <p>As no King was ever better beloved
by his Subjects whilſt living, ſo none
ever died more lamented than he; for
an Univerſal grief poſſeſt the minds of
all men, and like a Cloud ſuddenly
ſpread it ſelf over the whole Nation,
upon the arrival of that doleful
Tidings. He died in the Fifty fourth
Year of his Age, after he had reigned
Thirty ſix Years and ſome few days;
leaving his Kingdom, which he found
almoſt ruin'd with a bloody and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
War, in a ſtate of Tranquility

a Faction blown up into atempeſtuous
flame more violent and deaf than either
the Winds or the Seas, rendred him
the moſt Glorious and Admired Prince,
and his Subjects the moſt happy People
in Chriſtendom; and therefore in
what Words, or rather with what
Deeds can they ever expect to expreſs
a Gratitude any way equal to his
merits? Statues of <hi>Marble,</hi> and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal
Arches may indeed be an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of our Veneration, but
theſe are Trifles too mean to diſcharge
our debt, and therefore all true <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
ſhall raiſe him a more laſting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument,
by entombing him in their
Hearts, and expreſſing their love to
their Dead Sovereign, by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
Loyalty to their Living
One, our preſent Gracious King and
Governour <hi>James</hi> the Second; who
immediately upon his Death ſucceeded
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:57792:276"/>
to his Throne. For Nature is not
more careful to prevent a Diſſolution
of being, than the Conſtitution of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to prevent an <hi>Inter-Regnum</hi> of
Government; ſo that the ſame minute
which ſeems to threaten the involving
our Iſle in Darkneſs and Confuſion,
by the ſetting of one, really revives
our dying-hopes, and diſpels our ſable
Clouds by the riſing of another Sun,
for whom I ſhall pray as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
did for King <hi>Solomon,</hi> That God, by
whom alone Kings reign, and have
their Governments Crown'd with
Peace and Felicity, may pour upon
him the Bleſſings of Heaven in as great
a meaſure as upon his Royal Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
and make his Throne greater than
the Throne of our late Sovereign
Lord King <hi>Charles,</hi> and grant him
long to Live and Reign over us in
Peace and Tranquility.</p>
               <p>His Funeral was privately Solemniz'd

<hi>Labyrinths,</hi> and wonderful
Revolutions of His Life, to

                  <hi>Character.</hi> A Character,
which were I able therein to

deſerved <hi>Praiſe,</hi> would not
be parallel'd in <hi>Ancient,</hi> and
remain a <hi>Wonder</hi> to all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding

his Perfections were ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
and rare, that my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatious</hi>
of him will
no more bear <hi>Proportion</hi>
to his <hi>real worth,</hi> than the
twinkling <hi>Figure</hi> of the
<hi>Sun</hi> ſhining in the <hi>Water</hi>
(wherein he views him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as in a Looking-Glaſs)
is <hi>adequate</hi> to the <hi>Greatneſs</hi>
of that real body of <hi>Fire</hi>
and <hi>Light,</hi> whereby he claims
the <hi>Regency</hi> of Heaven.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Monarch</hi> as to his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
                  <pb n="481" facs="tcp:57792:278"/>
was of a <hi>tall</hi> and <hi>goodly</hi>
Stature, and ſo exactly form'd,
that the moſt curious and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating

ſomewhat <hi>dark,</hi> but much

<hi>Curling</hi> into large <hi>Rings,</hi>

the <hi>Jewel</hi> is more valuable than
the <hi>Casket</hi> that contains it, ſo
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:57792:279"/>
the perfections of his <hi>Mind</hi>
did much exceed thoſe of his

               </p>
               <p>He had been himſelf a <hi>Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi>
and had thereby learnt to
Govern his <hi>Subjects</hi> with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
He had been in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery,
and that taught him to be
Merciful. He had been <hi>unjuſtly</hi>
dealt with, and that made him
the more careful
to ſee <hi>right</hi> done

ſo that <hi>Juſtice</hi> was impartially
<hi>adminiſtred</hi> throughout his
whole Reign, unleſs where
<hi>himſelf</hi> was <hi>party,</hi> and there
he would rather loſe his <hi>own
Cauſe,</hi> than have his <hi>Subjects</hi>
ſeem oppreſſed; nor was there
ever known ſo few <hi>Executions</hi>
in ſo long a <hi>Reign.</hi> And truly
when we (eſpecially for the
<hi>firſt Eighteen Years</hi> after the
<hi>Interregnum)</hi> conſider his <hi>great.</hi>
Mercy to <hi>Traytors,</hi> it looks as
if he deſign'd not to <hi>ſpare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
provided he could but
<hi>people</hi> again, or at leaſt keep
as full as poſſibly, a <hi>Nation,</hi>
which had been ſo monſtrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
emptied of men, by a long
unnatural and ſanguinary War.
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:57792:280"/>
For he was ever unwilling to
inflict the leaſt <hi>Severities</hi> upon
his offending Subjects, unleſs
when <hi>neceſſity</hi> of State, or the
<hi>nature</hi> of the Crime did bind
the hand of Mercy, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

rather for the <hi>publick,</hi> than
his <hi>own</hi> Secuirty.</p>
               <p>He always profeſſed to love
and ſeek <hi>Peace,</hi> and prefer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Troubles</hi> and <hi>Hazards</hi>
of <hi>War;</hi> wherein he was like
<hi>Solomon</hi> rather than <hi>David,</hi> and
imitated our <hi>Bleſſed</hi> Saviour,
who ſtiles himſelf the <hi>Prince of
Peace,</hi> ever bearing it in his
<hi>Princely mind,</hi> that when <hi>Chriſt</hi>
came <hi>into</hi> the <hi>World, Peace</hi> was
ſang by the Holy <hi>Angels,</hi> and
when he made his <hi>Exit, Peace</hi>
was the Legacy he bequeathed.
Nor can it be imagined, That
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:57792:281"/>
his deſire of <hi>Peace</hi> was the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of <hi>ſoftneſs</hi> or <hi>fear;</hi> for he
was both Active and Valiant:
but he had a <hi>Conduct</hi> peculiar
to himſelf in bringing about
<hi>his Purpoſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">His peaceable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> and
<hi>accompliſhing</hi> his
deſigns by the
moſt eaſie and gentle <hi>means,</hi>
and would do that by Peace
which <hi>others</hi> could not perform
by War, and effect more by
<hi>ſhewing</hi> his Sword, than others
could do by <hi>uſing</hi> it: He
knew the way to <hi>preſerve</hi> and
obtain <hi>Peace,</hi> was ſometimes
to pretend an <hi>inclination</hi> to
embrace War, and therefore
would, when <hi>provok'd,</hi> make
offers of the latter, till he had
mended the Conditions of the
<hi>former.</hi> By which means he
was more <hi>abſolutely,</hi> and with
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:57792:281"/>
far <hi>leſs charge</hi> to his Subjects,
the <hi>Arbitrator</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> than
any of his Predeceſſors had
ever been, and could at his
Pleaſure diſpence War and
Peace, where, and to whom, he
pleas'd; which makes it the
greater Wonder, That He who
was ſo great a Lover of Peace,
ſhould be ſo ſucceſsful in War:
for his <hi>Arms</hi> were always <hi>fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
nor did he ever after his
<hi>Reſtauration,</hi> know what a
<hi>miſcarriage</hi> meant. The Two
<hi>Rebellions</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by <hi>Victory,</hi> as if raiſed <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly</hi>
to encreaſe the Fame
of his <hi>Arms,</hi> which after ſo
long an <hi>interval</hi> of Peace,
<hi>wanted</hi> exerciſing; and in his
Wars with <hi>Holland, France,
Spain</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſued to for peace, before
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:57792:282"/>
he granted it; and the <hi>French
King</hi> did ever fear his <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi>
more than other <hi>Princes
performances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>exerciſing</hi> his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty,
he conſulted his own
<hi>Judgment</hi> rather than other
mens <hi>Affections</hi> or <hi>Intereſts,</hi> and
always reſerv'd the <hi>diſpoſal</hi> of
his <hi>Royal Favours</hi> to his own
<hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the fate of too <hi>many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
who are ruled by their
<hi>Favourites,</hi> and Govern'd by
thoſe whom they themſelves
have raiſed, he never admitted
any of his <hi>Nobles</hi>
to ſo <hi>familiar</hi> an
<hi>intimacy</hi> with
him,<note place="margin">His care to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Crown.</note> as to give

<pb n="489" facs="tcp:57792:282"/>
him, whom he greatly
<hi>loved,</hi> and upon whoſe Advice
and Counſel he much <hi>rely'd,</hi>
as <hi>Clarendon, Buckingham, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale,
Danby,</hi> and others; yet
none of them could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called his Favourites, as
<hi>Gaveſton</hi> and <hi>Spencer</hi> were the
<hi>Favourites</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond;
or the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Norfolk</hi>
of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second: And
altho he would frequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
his Parliaments with his
<hi>Intentions,</hi> and require their <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>
and aſſiſtance for the <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting</hi>
of them, yet he would
not endure they ſhould be too
<hi>poſitive</hi> or <hi>peremptory</hi> therein,
accounting that too great an
<hi>Invaſion</hi> of his Prerogative;
and would tell them, The
<hi>Right</hi> of <hi>making</hi> and <hi>managing</hi>
War and Peace, was inveſted
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:57792:283"/>
in Him, and if they thought
he would depart from any part
of that Right, they would find
themſelves miſtaken; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Reins of Government
in his own hands, he would
have the ſame care to maintain
them there, as he would have
to <hi>preſerve</hi> his own Perſon.</p>
               <p>His Prudence and Conduct
in managing the great Affairs
of his Kingdom was ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and ſucceſsful, that it is
rather to be wondred at, than
believed, and he made ſo many
<hi>good</hi> and <hi>wholſome</hi> Laws, every
one whereof was grounded
upon the moſt <hi>ſearching</hi> Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
of State for the <hi>Welfare</hi>
and ſecurity of His Subjects
and the maintaining the <hi>prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives</hi>
of the <hi>Crown,</hi> as no
Age before him could ever
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:57792:283"/>
boaſt of, which begot in all
men the greater Awe and <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of him; and yet there
is nothing more certain, than
that his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was as great
(if not greater) <hi>abroad</hi> than
at home,<note place="margin">His Prudence and Conduct.</note> tho perhaps not ſo
<hi>well grounded:</hi> for <hi>Forreigners</hi>
could not ſee at that diſtance
the <hi>paſſages</hi> of Affairs, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
by what Secret Councils
he always attained his <hi>own ends</hi>
and <hi>diſappointed</hi> the Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his <hi>Enemies</hi> abroad,
and the <hi>Factions</hi> at Home, and
were therefore forced to make
their <hi>Judgment</hi> upon the <hi>Iſſues</hi>
and Succeſs of them: No
Prince ever had a <hi>Wiſer Council</hi>
than He, and yet no Prince
ever <hi>needed</hi> it <hi>leſs,</hi> for he was
<hi>Himſelf</hi> a <hi>Counſellor</hi> to his
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:57792:284"/>
                  <hi>Council,</hi> and was able to direct
thoſe of whom he asked advice.
For he was as well skilled in
the Art of Kingſhip (as His
Royal Grandfather was wont
to term it), and had as great
an inſight into, and underſtood
as well the beſt Rules and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Government, as any
Prince that ever ſway'd a Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
which rendred him more
capable of exerciſing his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Office to the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of Himſelf, his Kingdom,
and the Proteſtant Religion,
and enabled Him to govern
His Subjects for ſo long a
Tract of Time with ſo much
exactneſs, that by his Wiſe and
Prudent Management he ſo
poized all jarring and different
Intereſts, as to preſerve the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace and Tranquility of
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:57792:284"/>
his Kingdom to the very laſt
Minute of His Life, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the many reſtleſs At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of unruly and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men, to diſturb it; and left
things in ſo good a poſture at
his Death, that his moſt Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Brother, and Royal and
Lawful Succeſſor, aſcended his
Imperial Throne with as much
Facility and Applauſe as any of
his Predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>He loved ſo well to ſee his
Subjects <hi>thrive,</hi> that he coveted
not ſo much to fill his <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi>
as to reign over a Rich
and <hi>Wealthy People;</hi> and thought
Money as well <hi>beſtowed,</hi> when
laid up in <hi>their</hi> Coffers, as
when it filled his <hi>own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was <hi>Religious</hi> toward
<hi>God,</hi> as well as juſt towards
man, and took care to promote
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:57792:285"/>
the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> as
well as the <hi>State.</hi> At His <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration</hi>
he found the Church
involved in <hi>Trouble,</hi> but left
her <hi>poſſeſſed</hi> of Peace; he
found her robbed and ſpoiled,
but left her Wealthy and Rich.
Her Prelates He reſtored to
their Ancient <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi>
and filled
Her Converts with
Joy and Gladneſs.<note place="margin">His Religion and Piety.</note>
He did not, like moſt Princes,
make <hi>Religion</hi> an <hi>Artifice</hi> of
State only, but accounted it
the <hi>Glory</hi> and Comfort of his
<hi>Life:</hi> His Soul in His <hi>private
Devotion</hi> ſoared ſo <hi>high,</hi> that
he ſeemed to be wholly <hi>ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed</hi>
up with the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
of the <hi>God</hi> whom he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored,
and with whom he
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:57792:285"/>
would plead in <hi>Prayer</hi> ſo <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,</hi>
and with ſuch <hi>Affection,</hi>
as tho he were reſolved to take
no <hi>denial.</hi> And one of the
<hi>Presbyterian Miniſters,</hi> who
attended the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> (ſent

clapt his hand upon his
<hi>Heart,</hi> and with a kind of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion</hi>
of Spirit, cried out to
thoſe that were with him, <hi>We
are not worthy of ſuch a King.</hi>
And that which was the <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
of all, his <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>zeal</hi>
proceeded not ſo much from
a <hi>deſire</hi> to <hi>ſeem</hi> Religious, as

from a <hi>ſolemn Dedication</hi> of his

at the <hi>Comprehenſiveneſs</hi>
of his Knowledg: So that as
he had by <hi>right of Nature,</hi> a
<hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Empire</hi> over the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi>
of one <hi>Part</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> He

               <p>He underſtood <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and

verſed in Ancient and Modern

ſo well,<note place="margin">His skill in Arts and Sciences.</note> that he
could readily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
Queries, and reſolve the

<hi>Niceties</hi> that were at any time
ſtarted about them; and had

the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of <hi>Things,</hi> that He
comprehended almoſt all kind
of <hi>Arts</hi> which contributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

or <hi>Service</hi> of Mankind.</p>
               <p>He underſtood the trueſt

therein, direct the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them far more uſeful both

any which had been formerly
built; and was as well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Rigging</hi> and <hi>Fitting</hi>
forth a <hi>Fleet</hi> for Sea: He had
great Skill in <hi>Guns,</hi> knew all
that belonged to their <hi>caſting;</hi>
and could tell upon <hi>firſt</hi> view,
whether they were <hi>mounted</hi> to
do Execution, or not.</p>
               <p>He was a great Lover of
<hi>ſtately Buildings,</hi> and ſeveral
Curious Edifices were either
built or repaired by Him: But
his <hi>greateſt</hi> Coſt and Care in
that kind was laid out in <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi>-Caſtle,
which he took more
<hi>delight</hi> in, than in any other of
His <hi>Palaces.</hi> Nor were His
Buildings all for <hi>Pomp,</hi> but

Curious and Stately Fabrick
of <hi>Chelſey</hi>-Colledg for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
of <hi>decayed</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
He underſtood Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Aſtronomy, and all the
parts of the Mathematicks to
ſuch a Degree that he is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to have attained a greater
Perfection therein, than any
Prince ever did before Him;
and took ſo much delight in
thoſe Pleaſant and Uſeful Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
that he endeavoured, as
much as poſſible, the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them in others; Witneſs
His Worthy Gift to the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital
of <hi>Chriſt</hi>-Church for the
Annual breeding up a certain
Number of the moſt Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
of their Children in the
Mathematical Studies; and the
Liberal Rewards which were
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:57792:290"/>
frequently beſtowed by Him
upon Ingenious Men, that
had any way contributed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the making thoſe Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
more eaſie and delightful,
or had been imployed by him
in any thing relating thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Recreations,</hi> for the moſt
part, were very <hi>ſtirring,</hi> and
ſuch as tended to
the making his
Body more <hi>Robuſt</hi> and ſtrong,<note place="margin">His Recreations.</note>
and maintaining it in <hi>Health</hi>
(which he enjoyed to as
great a degree as any Prince
in the World ever did), ſuch
as <hi>Riding, Hunting, Fiſhing,
Tennis,</hi> and the like. He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Walking</hi> extreamly, which
he would do ſo <hi>faſt,</hi> that his
Courtiers were ſometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to <hi>run,</hi> that ſo they might
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:57792:290"/>
keep pace with him: It being
his <hi>conſtant Cuſtom</hi> every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when he was in <hi>Town,</hi> to
Walk an hour or more in St.
<hi>James</hi>'s Park; and he deſigned
to have done ſo that <hi>very morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
he fell into his <hi>Fit.</hi> He took
great pleaſure likewiſe in
<hi>Swimming,</hi> which he could do
incomparably well to the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
and <hi>Admiration</hi> of thoſe,
that beheld him. And indeed
all his <hi>Recreations,</hi> as well as
thoſe publick and private <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
which had a more direct
<hi>tendency</hi> to the great <hi>concerns</hi>
of his Life, as a <hi>King,</hi> gave
delight and ſatisfaction to thoſe
who communicated in the
<hi>ſight</hi> of them: And his very
<hi>Diverſions</hi> were ſo <hi>ſerious</hi> and
pleaſing, that every part of his
time was thought to be <hi>well</hi>
                  <pb n="506" facs="tcp:57792:291"/>
ſpent, and to deſerve <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Never was Prince more <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>
and affectionate to his
<hi>Queen</hi> than he; for he ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<hi>Affronts</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to her,<note place="margin">His Love and Affection to his Queen.</note> as ill as
if they had been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to <hi>himſelf;</hi> And was as
tender of her Honour as of his
own. He was obſerved by
the <hi>Courtiers</hi> to be more
Rich and Splendid upon her
<hi>Birth-day</hi> than upon his own,
and to keep it with greater Joy
and <hi>Solemnity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vaſt Treaſure of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Knowledg which he
had acquired by his long <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
and <hi>Experience,</hi> was richly
ſet off and <hi>adorned</hi> by a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
ſmooth, and <hi>charming
Eloquence,</hi> whereby he could
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:57792:291"/>
                  <hi>readily</hi> expreſs his <hi>Sentiments</hi>
of things in ſo good a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
as that with a <hi>pleaſing</hi>
kind of <hi>Magick,</hi> it enchanted
the <hi>liſtning</hi> Ears of thoſe that
heard him, as ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by his Letters, Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Speeches.</p>
               <p>And to conclude all, He was
every way fitted, and made
for <hi>Government,</hi> as well as
<hi>born</hi> to be a <hi>King;</hi> and was
poſſeſſed of all thoſe <hi>excellent
Qualifications,</hi> which were we
to have had a liberty of <hi>choice,</hi>
would certainly have <hi>conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
us to have pitched upon him
for our <hi>Sovereign.</hi> For the
